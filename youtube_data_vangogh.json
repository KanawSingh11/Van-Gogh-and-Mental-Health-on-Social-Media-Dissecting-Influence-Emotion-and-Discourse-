Coincidentally, I was scheduled to take my teacher's certification exam that morning, too. I showed up because I figured that a fail was better than a no-show. My mind hadn't recovered yet, I was sleepy, a bit dazed, and still somewhat confused. My husband waited for me in the car. I was the first to finish--45 minutes for a 5 hour exam. Three weeks later, I got my results. I aced the exam!!! I could hardly form sentences while speaking, but somehow, I aced it. I know that seizures can spark creativity because I have lived it. FYI, it was an English/Composition exam.",

And the distortion you mention could also be a side effect of synesthesia (which is common among autism.) It's clear that he experienced psychotic breaks that were fueled by anxiety and depression. This was most likely bipolar, but could have also stemmed from schizophrenia- as he was very detached from conventional structure (which is also a symptom of ASD.)

There would be some cases where this may be over-ridden, I admit (I have family, for instance, prone to violence tied to their addictions and also inability to regulate emotions, even well before substance abuse started.  There are always exceptions...

I don't know why you want to see a neurosurgeon directly, while still self-diagnosed (if they don't instantly refer or dismiss you, they will probably just insist on a bunch of tests a neurologist can do).  I mean...  do you actually want surgery?  Without viable proof?  Or is it because you think neurosurgeons will know more...?

This quack would probably have every passionate, moody artist on heavy medication, drugged out of their minds.  Put her on lithium!

Most artists I have known in modern times or even personally don't do such things; I don't know about you...  Whether or not a person should be medicated doesn't detract from the fact Van Gogh was obviously fairly unusual even for an artist at that time -- at least for some of his life.  We can't exactly talk it out with him...",

I don't know what a \"Ductch G\" sounds like (will have to look it up) -- no idea such a thing existed.  A lot of people in East Asian countries have problems with the fact English doesn't usually put lots of vowels between consonants, and I'm not used to English speakers putting down the alteration of pronunciation down of English words (be it pronouncing in any native-speaking English country).  I find knowing how to speak/read/pronounce foreign languages very impressive (and I took Spanish extensively, I am terrible at it, and I have worked with a number of non-Native English speakers -- some knowing basically not knowing anything at all at first, or perhaps, ever, if they are there temporarily and not as a refugee/immigrant/student).  \n\nIf an English speaker went all nuts over a Dutch person not pronouncing a letter or sound the same way we do, wherever we are from that happens to speak English, only the complete jerks would even bring it up!  Seriously, I don't understand why you don't simply *teach* the proper pronunciation if you are that concerned?  Not all native-English speakers have a superiority complex...",

                            "text": "Schizophrenia is a mental form of morphing realities, including visuals, thoughts etc. the process of art is creating by interpreting realities as well. Ive heard an interpretation that schizophrenia is simply the inability to filter and block the influx of input into your psychi/third eye during the episodes and that it is a complete bombarded creation from the subtle, or gross energies surrounding us constantly. So schizo anything , is already the inability to avoid a wild interpretation of reality. It‚Äôs a creating disease of the brain. It is the inability to avoid building things in your mind off of other things. Doesn‚Äôt matter the vibration, it‚Äôs the creation process. Also life is the process of creating and creativity. Everything you see is because someone created what was in their mental eye. Even a toothbrush. Even when you write a note. Your penmanship is an expression of your creativity even. People just don‚Äôt realize. The degree to which I choose to express that, is solely based on effort. When I was young, one of my things was that people would literally turn into a 2-d Picasso interpretation of their face. No dimensions. flat. their mouths would speak sideways. Or another example is no matter what environment for 4-5years, any surface with texture my brain would turn everything into hundred of tiny demoniac faces  covering walls, forests, cars, anything and whatever I was surrounded by. and they would whisper. I‚Äôm an artist and I could‚Äôve really profited off that. I couldn‚Äôt turn it off even if I wanted to. But, I am an artist who purposefully did NOT create what my episodes would create, in hopes to stop the creations. And to some degree- it did work. and now I‚Äôm able to more purposefully navigate it. Just because it is sometimes negative, doesn‚Äôt mean it is not creation. For reference, the definition of creativity is: ‚Äúthe characteristic of a person to generate new ideas, alternatives, solutions, and possibilities in a unique and different way. Creativity is the ability to conceive something unpredictable, original and unique. It must be expressive, exciting and imaginative.‚Äù Hopefully this helps to understand!",

Van Gogh spent time in mental institutions and wrote about his experiences of illness to his brother Theo. \nEvidence of mental illness in Van Gogh is undeniable and it makes me angry that people try to deny it.",

While this tends to handicap the former, it tends to benefit the latter, who gain creativity from increased use of the right hemisphere and increased communication between the right and left hemispheres. This increased inter-hemispheric communication also occurs in schizophrenia sufferers, but their cognitive processes tend to be too disorganized for them to make productive use of it.\r\n\r\nSome healthy relatives of schizophrenia sufferers may be so close to schizophrenia on the spectrum of normality as to meet the diagnostic criteria for schizotypal personality disorder. Many more relatives who do not meet the threshold for schizotypal disorder may nonetheless have mild schizo-typal traits, such as divergent or idiosyncratic thinking, which are linked with creativity.\"\nSource: Neel Burton M.D. Mad Genius: Schizophrenia and Creativity",

Every time I close my eyes, even if I‚Äôm just kissing my fianc√©, I see weird stuff.  A lot of times it‚Äôs distorted cartoon figures that can be kinda disturbing. I don‚Äôt have to have my eyes closed for these hallucinations to happen, it could just be a blank slate like the sky or a wall.\n\nThen whenever it‚Äôs real intense there‚Äôs another level of hallucinations that go on in front of or behind those images, they are like bouncy jiggly shapes that somehow feel like beings. Like my brain identifies them as a being. These hallucinations don‚Äôt fade but are like I‚Äôm watching a video at 60 frames per second. They are usually dark grey or black and can get ‚Äúcovered‚Äù by the usual closed eye images I talked about earlier.\n\nI also have open eye hallucinations that I can go into more detail if anyone is curious about those lol",

His parents probably had enough of him sponging off them, treating them like garbage, acting like he was special and a a victim.",

He failed to find this, at least, something satisfactory enough to keep on going.  I dare say if he'd had a little of the commerical success he has now, then he may have lasted a bit longer. Rather than claiming that 1 in 4 have mental health issues like him and that it shouldn't define us, let's instead look at it as a reflection of social ills. It does define people, do not say otherwise. Just not in the way that Tate can officially comprehend.",

One of\n\nthe boys had his father‚Äôs rifle and decided to ‚Äútake a shot‚Äù at the painter and he\n\nwounded him. The gang of boys went to Van Gogh‚Äôs aid feeling terrible remorse\n\nas reality crept back into their thinking. Van Gogh knew that the boys would be\n\nin a lot of trouble, which would possibly effect the rest of their lives, and he told\n\nthem not to worry, but to keep quiet about the entire incident. Van Gogh made it\n\nback to town (Arles, if I‚Äôm not mistaken), where the townspeople naturally assumed \n\nthe artist had attempted suicide again. Not long before, Van Gogh had nearly sliced \n\noff an ear in a dramatic attempt to show a prostitute how devoted he was to her, and\n\nso his mental state was already in question. Long story short: Brother Theo rushed to\n\nhis side where he lay in bed for, I believe, approximately five to seven days and nights\n\nbefore succumbing to his bullet wound, most likely blood poisoning.\n\nMany years later one of the boys, a remaining survivor of those who were along that \n\nfateful day, wanted to clear his conscience once and for all before he died, and came\n\nforward with a full confession. Very admirable! Especially to restoring the reputation of\n\none of the world‚Äôs greatest artists.\n\nIf you are interested, you may be able to find an account of the entire incident in an\n\nepisode of ‚Äò60 Minutes,‚Äô a popular TV news investigation ‚Äúmagazine‚Äù in the U.S.",

And those voices/sounds/visions are usually anything but friendly, otherwise people wouldn‚Äôt suffer so terribly (or would be mystics). Also, they mention lows and passion which might hint to manic-depressive episodes which are common with schizoaffective disorder. The advancements in psychiatry are one of the greatest achievements of medicine üíõ\nNow, what the video tried to say was, I think, to not reduce Van Gogh only to his mental illness. Most of the time and especially when he painted, he was not ¬´¬†ill¬†¬ª. I see his genius not coming out primarily due to the mental disorders - but he had developed and progresses his art and technique over time. He had the brillant idea to express mood with color - rather than using color to paint as realistically as possible, as was the common thing to do in Van Gogh‚Äôs time. This did not come from a place of madness but from a highly artistic, perceptive, intelligent and sensitive mind.",

Since he was relieved by his work in painting, he surely wouldn't have worked so intensely, some might even say manically to keep the episodes at bay. An artist's mental state and their work are inseparable. \n\nHere is a letter Theo wrote about van Gogh's death. - He himself wanted to die, when I sat at his bedside and said that we would try to get him better and that we hoped that he would then be spared this kind of despair, he said, ‚ÄúLa tristesse durera toujours‚Äù [The sadness will last forever]. I understood what he wanted to say with those words.\n\nA few moments later he felt suffocated and within one minute he closed his eyes.

It would have een weird anyway if two Dutch brothers would choose to speak in a froreign language together instead of their own native language. Vincent also said to his brother that he wanted him to take him home to the Netherlands. The quote you gave is the French translation of what he said in Dutch to his brother. As is often the case with history many things get lost in translation... Just like Vincent's suicide story. We will never know exactly what happened that day. But it seems bizarre that anyone would even consider giving a gun to the local 'mad'foreigner who had cut off his own ear in a spell of madness and had only just come to live in their village. If a total stranger with a reputation like that would ask you if he could lend your gun would you give it to him? Also it was not common to even own a gun in Auvers at that time. Where could Vincent have even gotten the gun from? Nobody owned one. Except one boy who was known to bully Vincent 'the foreigner madman who was easy to startle' from the day he arrived in Auvers. Could there have been a tragic accident? And Vincent covering up to protect the boy?",

John Ratcliffe used to suggest that the suicide was because Van Gogh's brother had just informed him of his forthcoming marriage, which meant that he would no longer be able to provide Vincent with the basic income on which he depended. Perhaps that contributed, perhaps also he was experiencing a period of relative emotional stability and of high achievement in his painting and made a rational decision to end his life at a high point. The question of whether his emtional or neurological condition in any way affected the appearance of his paintings is not addressed here by the Tate.",

Artists without mental illness simply do not have that contribution to their work. Either way, art is made.",

I don't think anyone unfamiliar with deep despair can make any art with existential depth and meaning. \nEver noticed that all the people you come across and REALLY admire, or courageous or kind-hearted are people who are or have been through very hard things? Everything of value, everything meaningful is made through struggle. And the greater the struggle, the greater the art. \nI don't think that reduces him to his illness. I think it tells a story of the triumph of meaning and beauty through overcoming tragedy. That's the story of the whole world. That is what justifies life, art and love.",

How is that even possible ?\n\nAnd why did no one ask this question in documentaries and online discussions ?\n\nAm I the only one to suspect Theo was actively suppressing Vincent's art's exposure to the world ?\n\nDo note that the few times Vincent's paintings were exhibited in his lifetime, it was mostly by invitation from people who knew Vincent ... His brother Theo had never bothered to give him a solo exhibition like he did for Monet even though Theo was sitting on about 900 of Vincent's paintings...\n\nAnd Vincent's art style is not even that different from other famed artists of his time, he frequently tried to incorporate styles of artists he admires like Seurat, Millet etc and his color palette was every bit as vibrant as Monet's ... What stood out in Vincent's paintings was the unmistakable emotional undercurrent of his paintings..\n\nIts ironical that its Theo's wife did what Theo never did for Vincent, she organised solo post-humous exhibitions for Vincent and toured the paintings all over europe ... and she's not even professionally trained as an art dealer like Theo !",

The same is true now (I read): many obviously neurological illness/injury/disease are STILL said to be 'mental health problems' = because of doctors' ignorance, that it's easy to 'diagnose' instead of doing expensive tests which many don't have insurance cover for - but also if insured the insurers prefer these 'diagnoses' = cheaper - and I think some policies don't cover 'mental health' - though how on earth you can (and why would you want to) separate mental and physical health must be impossible because the brain controls not only the whole body but also our thoughts and feelings. Some people become 'savants' (genius) after a brain injury (and illness/disease), some people discover/achieve unusual strengths in art, music , maths etc. after a stroke or other brain injury = maybe Vincent had one of these things happen to his brain but at that time no understanding of how eg viruses can affect the brain and no MRIs and just said to be 'mad'. His great art was a product of him and his brain, result: genius! Got to stop: getting scrambled due to my brain injury!",

As someone with autism who only realsied at the age of 37, I've been plagued with horrendous mental health issues. But my love of writing (among other things) has kept me alive. \n\nI have an artist friend who is also autistic, and her art has lots in common with his. She says she paints in this style because it soothes her anxiety.\n\nWhile not all savants are autistic, per person, far more savants are autistic. I think he was an autistic savant dealing with huge sensory and cognitive issues. His temper makes perfect sense with autism too as irritability is a big part of being overstimulated. There is also a much higher rate of addiction with autistics. We're also 5x more likely to unalive ourselves. He suffered, but in much of his art we see someone enjoying a temporary break from his pain. This is the solace all autistic people take in their special interests.",

I thought everyone got so down after losing the people close to them, but discovered that wasn't the case. I eventually was put on antidepressants after serving in the military for 15 years. I was 32 when that happened. \nAt first, I improved greatly, though eventually the treatment lost its appeal. \nI have always questioned Van Gough's suicide. If you want to kill yourself the stomach makes a poor target, much pain, and does not guarantee the desired result. \nI've had friends who have crossed over from suicide as one of the 22 per-day military veterans. \nMy wife is a mental health counselor who tries to assist those feeling suicidal, especially veterans like me. \nI'm glad more people are questioning Van Gogh's \"suicide.\"\nSgi, my friend, excellent video.",

The liege gun works exploited Belgium‚Äôs very weak intellectual property laws to manufacture designs invented elsewhere, and they copied designs from the US, UK, and France.  \n\nThe example in question was made several years before Vincent‚Äôs death.  It is a a copy of the French lefechoux design and was very common throughout Europe at the time.  It was inexpensive to manufacture and buy even at the time, it utilized very low pressure cartridges that did not require particularly strong steel.  As a result any wounds caused by these guns were quite small compared to earlier cap and ball revolvers or later centerfire revolvers.  They had calibers as small as 7mm, and could easily fit in a medium sized pocket without notice, or a rather small pocket if nobody was explicitly looking for the outline of a gun in a persons clothing.  \nThese revolvers were exported all over the place, and generally cost a third or half as much as contemporary British designs.  \n\nIt would not be particularly hard for Vincent or anyone else to get one of these revolvers. Or for it to be lost on a field.  Moreover it‚Äôs lack of firepower  meant that any gunshot would would transfer very little kinetic energy, and would instead be like simply having a hole poked in you.  The long time for Vincent to die likely indicates a punctured organ as a result of the gunshot being the reason he died.  \n\nAh, should have kept watching, you directly mention the same gun and caliber lol.  But one thing of note is that pinfire ammo is very unreliable, it is entirely possible that not all the powder burned.  It is definitely worth considering.",

A lot of people only seen him as a ‚Äúicon‚Äù of the miserable artist stereotype, not taking in consideration the skills he had to learn, by himself, to paint what he did. He wanted to do something to be remembered, but it seems people only remember his tragedy, something he had no power in, and I don‚Äôt blame that, it is a depressing story, I can‚Äôt imagine his suffering, but I can‚Äôt help but think how strong he was to still make beautiful coherent and deep artworks. His mental state did obviously affect the way he painted and the consistency, but he did not paint the masterful way he did because of his mental illness. He practiced for years, he suffered through it, but he did, all while managing to express his tumultuous state in his style, but was it his mental state that made him paint the way that it did? The coats and coats of paint, the spirals, the lines and dynamism of his paintings.. was it just because he was sick? I don‚Äôt think so\nI‚Äôm only writing this, because I‚Äôve seen so many people talk about him and his story, because obviously it resonates with us, but so many seem to attribute his skill to his mental illness.. I don‚Äôt think he would like to be remembered like that..",

My friend sought insights, he found the light to be wonderful there, he walked locations in hope of catching something in the air, a wisp of a feeling drifting past like a curl of smoke, a glimpsed ghost.  He spoke with older people, many of whom had known VG as a man not merely a myth. My friend was told VG shot himself in the genitals, that this was known at the time but politely and discreetly kept quiet.  If that was just village gossip or the unglamorous unvarnished truth we cannot now know but my friend believed it to his dying day and I can only do likewise in his honour.",

She also talked at length about how she firmly believed he was covering for someone wrt his death, bc she was obsessed with him and his art. She was the same teacher who told me I should stop confining my work to small pages/canvases, and said I was much more suited for large expressive strokes on 8-12ft large mediums and was going to assign that to me as a year long project for Art 2. Unfortunately, her class filled up before I could register and I ended up dropping out not long after. Never got the chance to work on such a big canvas or sit with her after class and talk about art and its history again, but hopefully one day I will.",

Like I could say \"I myself am injured!\" In English and it would be clear that I did not necessarily injure myself, and curiously the French word order would be similar to this. \"J'ai m'ete bless√©\" would be most natural to me. Not sure exactly what Vincent said.",

And in doing so for its own safty in hiding it creats things in your minds like mental illness. A physical expression used to hide spiritual posession or embodiment. We recently saw this in the grunge era with the deaths of 4 seperate voices. Mother Love Bone, Curt cobain, Lane Stanley, and Chris Cornel. Additionally, many around these greats also died too. And again it is dismissed as addiction, mental illness and the like. Evil is this world and is expressed in everything. However, contrast must be present too for its existsnce and direction to grow away from one aspect toward the other and finally to blend the two before completion of our learning at this level of development. Quick to admire and even quicker to blame. I am an artist of many forms who also burned every work I did upon discovery of spirit transmitting through it, as it does in music, poetry and all art. Anything that pople are emotionally attracted to are the ways it is expressed and lives. Now stop for one second and look at the Catholic religion and its grandiose chapples. Namely the Sisteen Chappelle. Or any of their churches. That art, stained windows and even sounds like bells are ways evil transmitts into minds unknowingly. There is much much more to this but my time and spce here is limited. Oh and the new age spiritual analysis is also smoke and mirrors with science and quantum bullshit as just a distraction in counterpart. Just live life felling all of it, grow and die. We are but leaves on a tree in metaphoric discription",

If it is recalled, around the time of his death, he was working on paintings of landscapes showing so many crows accentuating some hidden statement, (or, so I imagine). Perhaps, the flock of crows became too many to work with. And, Vincent in his frustration and despair, withdrew the gun he must have always carried, and accidentally it went off and fatally wounded him. I say this because where he shot himself, on his side, close to his abdomen, is such an unlikely place to shoot oneself, hoping to end one's life. Dramatically, it is said that his death was a suicide, or, that someone had killed him. But I think the reality of his death was less sensational.",

Like i guess it would be interesting if some of the points were provable facts or convincing. You mention when Vincent was being treated by the doctor, Vincent said he didn't want to die. HOW is this surprising?? This is extremely common with people who survive suicide attempts. Knowing Vincents life and how suicidal he was for most of his adult life, you'll need a lot of convincing evidence to supersede the likeliness of him commiting suicide. \"why didn't the doctor record the gun powder burn?\" you mean the same doctor that let him die a painful 30 hour death as you mention? Could it be perhaps he was not a great doctor in the 1800s? lol. Also the people who reexamined the gun trajectory admitted that they had very little evidence to go by so is it even relevant? theres a lot more to say. the end of the video where you mention a farmer finding a gun that they just assumed was vincents is wild to even entertain, lmao.",

He left the art school without completing the training, but he had most definitely received formal training. This is not to diminish Vincent's genius, but I feel it an important point as others may quote the inaccuracy.",

Like, if he had slept with someone‚Äôs wife (100% making these examples up to be clear) or did something undeniably inappropriate or cruel to someone during a bad moment‚Ä¶.\nThe children fits too, imo, if they were teasing him (as ppl did- god imagine? Ppl mock artists as odd even today- imagine then? Unmarried and covered in paint, also mentally off? They must‚Äôve thought he was a freak & most were probably unkind to him) or threatening him with the gun, and then accidentally shot him‚Ä¶ I could understand why, especially if they seemed remorseful. Sincerely, he may make a secret of that.\nThe other option I thought of would be if it were something that he didn‚Äôt want attached to his name like if he had been shot by a gay lover, or something like that. This seems unlikely (that if he were gay, he would meet another gay man hundreds of years ago in a very small town that he just arrived in two months before), but you never know.\nWhatever the case, I just really feel like he felt the person either had the right to be this angry at him, or that it was sincerely an accident like in the case with if it were kids.\nIt seems odd if he shot himself that he would go back to the house and try to get help‚Ä¶ Why not just lay in the field there? Of course, he could‚Äôve changed his mind once he was wounded. \n\nWhatever the case, I‚Äôve always been drawn to van Gogh, and his story is so very sad. I saw all his works in an exhibit‚Ä¶ Well, not literally all of them, but you know what I mean‚Ä¶ I was shocked by how emotional it made me. I always thought they were cool paintings, but it‚Äôs like they had a magic spell on them or something. he was so talented. Obviously. lol \nAt the very least, I‚Äôm glad that it seems like he was happy, and a peaceful place during the last month of his life. And that he was with his brother. Both of those things make the situation much better. Or at least are a small bit of light in a very dark situation. \n\nGreat video \nRIP Vincent- ty for your art  ‚ù§ü•≤",

Might as well buy some just in case tomorrow comes!\n\nI loved this video btw... I just wanted to point out this trap that people fall into that's really quite obvious.\n\nOf course a suicidal painter will request more paints. \n(Not saying that he did kill himself... just that if you're suicidal for half a day, you'll probably get over it... and if you're suicidal for years, you'll probably still buy milk)",

Your choice of graphics through the video was reminiscent Vincent's aesthetic. I learned so much, and I realized how I could relate to Vincent, and how lucky I am to have modern medicine to keep my hands on the wheel. Even as helpless to his illness as he was, I still admire him. Vincent created with his whole being, and I hope to always do the same, even sitting with my own demons.",

It's less like a tide where weeks or months can be more or less depressed, and can be a lot more rapid, especially for someone whos comorbid with psychosis. Our pattern seeking brains like to weave narritive consistency through someones mental state, but the truth is that most suicides happen in the spur of the moment. Just because someone seemed to be \"coming out of it\" weeks or days before doesn't mean there's not still a risk of suicide every day for a person who suffers with depression. There are no high ideals when you're alone with unbearable mental pain. Of course this is anecdotal, but honestly so are all of the arguments in this video. These are my 2 cents from a person who's tired of seeing bad hypotheses come from people who can't know what it's like to have a mental illness.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum can say it better than I can: \"The recently raised theory that he had been shot by schoolboys is entirely unfounded and can be dismissed.\"\nhttps://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/art-and-stories/stories/the-last-days-of-vincent-van-gogh",

It's oddly comforting to realize that a huge majority of brilliant, tragic figures labeled 'crazy' in the past were likely just autistic and deeply traumatized. Though their stories often end in suicide, somehow it helps me feel less alone, cradled in the knowledge that others with minds like mine have always existed and will always exist. I'm also deeply grateful to live in a time where autistic minds are becoming more understood, and less vilified.",

I find a certain calmness and familiarity in it that helps me figure out my thoughts. I went to the Van Gogh Museum knowing very little about Vincen van Gogh. Obviously I knew who he was, because he is a world-famous Dutch artist and he was spoken of frequently in my school, but I never knew his life story. I'm so glad I want to that museum. First of all, his art is beautiful to me. It's so raw, in a way‚Äîthe messy brush strokes, slight imperfections here and there... I could relate to it, on a personal level but also on an artistic level. But I think what really brought me down to my knees and to tears was the story behind all his art. Before he moved to Paris, his art was dark, gloomy, and overall just depressing. (Take 'De Aardappeleters / The Potato Eaters' for example). But then he found France and his art just... lit up. Literally. Vibrant colours, beautiful landscapes... it was all there. And to know he was suffering and struggling so greatly at that time makes me really melancholic. His life story is so deeply sad, I cried in the car ride home, which was also a result of my mother's friend playing 'Vincent' by Don McLean, which to this day is still a song that can bring me to tears with only the first few notes.\n\nVincent van Gogh was so misunderstood, and it genuinely makes my heart ache. I don't suffer from the mental problems he suffers from, but I do suffer from other mental illness. I wish he could've gotten the help he needed. I wish he was loved by more than just his brother. I wish someone bothered to see him, hear him, understand him. I could talk about Vincent van Gogh for hours on end (if that wasn't clear yet by now), but I won't bother anyone with that. This video was beautiful, and I hope more people will get to see all sides of Vincent.",

But my two cents is that he might've killed himself, or he might not have. As you said, his last weeks of life he reached a ''psychotic level'' of mental anguish, so it's hard to make sense of any of his actions during this time. The most painful thing about suicide, is just how little sense it makes.",

Maybe it was just a stupid accident, a child's play in which he protected himself or attacked someone, as usual. Its been established he had a pattern of arguing with other men with physical altercations. Paterns dont stop if we change people or houses. Maybe he, himself was caught off guard in the face of his imminent death. Thats quite a shock to the body and, in trauma mode, the blood takes quick shelter in internal organs. He seemed to have had self injurious behaviors before but never went over the threshold to self anihilate. He sounded quite serene in his statements and, even if suicide was punished by the law, who cares about that when you know you're dying. Gemini people are the type that often appear split, \"skizo\" or \"bipolar\", as they look for joy and are usually very social, flirty, have briliant ideas, but when one twin is evil and one is good, the union of opposits turns into a Castor and Pollux story. Take, lets say, his sympathetic bro, portrayed as kind, supportive, a caretaker. Its very hard to care for a mentally ill sibling, but sibling rivalry is often overlooked as is the caretaker's resentment. If his bro was dealing art, Vincent was creating it. You cant have one without the other, Vincent appears to resent his bro. Bro doesn't try to sell his paintings even if he is counscious of Vincent's creative fler. Vincent cant fit in big or small cities, develops alcoholism. Who pays his bills?! The good sibling is not always the sane one, but he might be considered socially sane because he makes money. Mental issues are rather a combination of nurturing styles and environmental struggles. Creative, spiritual people dont actually care about money, and maybe that was considered as unacceptable, to leave life vicariously and just do what makes you üòä happy, Gemini style. Well, I wrote too much üòÖ. Thank you for your work.",

Vincent had attempted several times before. He did it. Period. He went back down the hill after the deed cuz LOTS of people have second thoughts after an attempt. Just look at the survivors of the Bay bridge. The survival instinct is terribly strong. \n\nAnd just cuz no powder burns were remarked doesn't mean they weren't there. He was a pauper, everyone who treated him tended to, well...not do their due diligence, shall we say. So the bullet trajectory and other details may have been inaccurately reported cuz the ones documenting it just wanted to get it over with.",

She would also overwork herself and barely sleep, leading her to suffer numerous breakdowns and eventually take her own life. Her husband continued drawing her works but grieved over her a lot.",

Don't feel too bad though because turpentine and various solvents made things far worse and even today many are clueless to such things nor factor it in. Many make it worse, while some make it better. \n\nPoint is there are many factors not being considered which really chaps my ass sometimes, but in reality there is not much that can be done.\n\nThis is one reason I factor things into my sales prices. The current negotiating strategies (some cultures thrive on deal making in one way or another ) that create a reaction in me that makes me want to just shoot the cheap tard in the head (not literally, it's figurative to convey a point of anger response the cheap or frugal cultures that are clueless to their cultural destructiveness ). I usually just shutdown and want nothing to do with them. I digress.\n\nVincent Van Go had many factors, including being a \"ginger\" (nephillim/Elom/Esau blood liable conspiracies ) which I sure he was well aware of which assisted in self-loathing and concern that he shared with no one. I garauntee he was well aware of it because it reflects in much of his work if you know what to look  at. He was not a big conversationlist. One big irony (having spoken to several Vincent scholars/experts and novices). Very few pick up on it, or blow it off because they think they know better. Same with H. Bosch whose life was not well documented creating so much room for speculation which has also been weaponized by many manipulating values for work. weaponization of everything for artists creates lethal competition by \"inspired\" artists of then and today.\n\nAnother fascinating artist was El Greco who was addicted to his own works to the point that he would break into monasteries/churches or homes of those who aqquired his works to continue working on them to the point of ruining them and he wasn't a popular artist then so his motive wasn't financial. I liken him to the Winchester Mystery House Syndrome üòÇüòÇ‚ù§). My big point is the cadmium, solvents and other possible poisons were not well understood in various eras but still it's rarely discussed or factored in which is yet another reason I shudder when the term \"expert\" gets tossed around in the artworld.\n\nBeing an artist has always been a blessing and a curse, like most life is.\n\nOne of the best and most informative movies based on Vincent was \"Lust For Life\" and even that was seriously lacking but it is still the best Hollywood ever made about him with availiable information.",

I'm positive that he was completely out of his mind when he did it, and had absolutely no idea what he was doing.  And I know for a fact that, had he been found in time and stopped, he would've wanted to be saved, too.  Such a sad story.  I'm glad Vincent's brother supported him.  I wish more people in that time had had the same kind of sympathy for people suffering mental illness that Theo had.",

                    "text": "It is interesting to consider the options.  We do try to frame things through logic, but it is surprising how often a strange happenstance interferes with the rational.  I recognized this when a friend of the family, a young mercurial type with a lot of pent up creativity looking for an outlet, told of his adventure.\n\nOne day, our friend and his companion discovered a box of 22 shells in the boy's father's garage and stole away with it. When sharing the this find with our family friend, they somehow got the idea that smacking the bullets between two rocks would be fun, or at least a creative distraction to another otherwise dull afternoon. Within minutes, the bullet fired lodging itself deeply into the palm and forearm of his hand.  The boys ran for help and an ambulance arrived in short dispatch where our friend's hand was treated and he was taken to the hospital.  Of course, this story went through about 5 or 6 iterations as our combined families, law enforcement, and the town insurance agent attempted to find how this injury happened. \n\nThe other boy in the story went home and said nothing to anyone per their agreement!  It was curious how a solitary individual might come to the act of exploding a bullet into his own hand which created a town mystery of sorts.  I believe there are often stories like this one that could be discovered given there were proper assurances that there wouldn't be trouble awaiting those involved.  Weird things happen and you are right to be suspicious about Vincent.  His death, like his life, is so much the story of those who don't mesh well with the time and place they lived.",

                    "text": "\"Vincent Van Gogh, one of the Dutch painters, could not sell a single painting in his whole life. Now only two hundred paintings have survived out of thousands that he painted, because nobody took care of them. He was simply distributing them to friends; nobody would purchase them. People were afraid even to hang his paintings in their sitting rooms because whoever would see them would think that they were crazy: what kind of painting are you hanging here? People were taking them ‚Äî not to hurt him ‚Äî thanking him, and throwing his paintings into their basements so nobody would see. Now each of his paintings is worth a million dollars. What happened in one hundred years? The man himself was forced into a mad asylum when he was only thirty-two. And he was forced because of his painting ‚Äî he was not harmful, he was not violent, he was not doing anything to anybody. But anybody who looked at his paintings was absolutely certain that this man was mad and unreliable. He should be put in a madhouse. If he could paint these things, he might do anything‚Ä¶.‚Äù For example, he always painted stars as spirals. Even other painters told him, ‚ÄúStars are not spirals!‚Äù\r\n\r\nHe said, ‚ÄúI also see the stars. I see that they are not spirals, but the moment I start painting them something in me says so strongly that they are spirals. The distance is so vast‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why your eyes cannot see exactly what their shape is. And the voice is so strong. I am simply unable to do anything else but what my inner being says to do.‚Äù\r\n\r\nAnd now physicists have discovered that stars are spirals. It has gone like a shock throughout the world of painters, that only one painter in the whole history of man had some inner contact and communication with the stars ‚Äî and that was a man who was thought to be mad. And because he was thought to be mad, nobody was ready to give him any service. Every week, his brother used to give him enough money to last for seven days. And he was fasting three days in a week and eating four days ‚Äî because that was the only way to purchase canvas and colors and brushes to paint. Painting was more important than life. He committed suicide at the age of thirty -three. Just after his release from the madhouse, he painted only one painting, which they had prevented him from painting in the madhouse. He wanted to paint the sun. It took him one year. He lost his eyes‚Ä¶ the burning sun, the hot sun, and the whole day long he would be watching all the colors, from the morning till the evening, from the sunrise to the sunset. He wanted the painting to contain everything about the sun, the whole biography of the sun. Everybody who was sympathetic to him told him, ‚ÄúThis is too much. Just studying it one day is enough; it is the same sun.‚Äù\r\n\r\nVan Gogh said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know. It is never the same. You have never looked at it. I have never seen the same sunrise twice, never seen the same sunset again. And I want my painting to be a biography.‚Äù One year‚Ä¶ the whole day watching the sun‚Ä¶ He lost his eyes, but he painted. And when the painting was complete, he wrote a small letter to his brother: ‚ÄúI am not committing suicide out of any despair ‚Äî because I am one of the most successful men in the world. I have done whatever I wanted to do in spite of the whole world condemning me. But this was my last wish, to paint the whole biography of the sun in one painting. It is completed today. I am immensely joyful, and now there is no need to live. I was living to paint; painting was my life, not breathing.‚Äù And he shot himself dead. You cannot categorize him with ordinary suicides. It is not a suicide ‚Äî out of despair, out of sadness, out of failure ‚Äî no. Out of immense success, out of total fulfillment, seeing that now, why unnecessarily go on living and waiting for death?‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have done the work that I wanted to do.‚Äù Every creative artist has to understand this: the moment people start thinking about him that he is a little bit off center, that something is loose in his head, he should rejoice that he has crossed the boundary of the mundane and the mediocre. Now he has grown the wings which others don‚Äôt have.\"",

I‚Äôd love to know what gun was found and if it was something some kids could‚Äôve had, or if it was some very rare pistol that would be locked away in a display case.   I just feel like Vincent saw his life taken away from him for his poor choices, and didn‚Äôt want to condemn 2 other boys to the same fate he had - a life stolen\n\nJust seems most probable.  Especially with how he worded it when he said if he shot himself.  Mentioning he did it and acted alone.  Just weird wording, but it may be out of context.\n\nIn any case, he was afraid he wouldn‚Äôt contribute to the world, and in his doing he became one of the most influential artists to date.",

Maybe his guilt for the conflict he caused in life overcame him after being shot, and the thought of anymore of it brought him traumatic memories and he just wanted peace.\n\nHe just wants to bring peace, art, comfort and necessity to the world, what a loving guy Vincent is.",

I looked it up to see if it still looked as I remembered and it pretty much did.. but this time, I decided I liked it.\n\nA failure? I dunno. I kinda like that Landscape with Snow, and I'm glad he painted it.",

During these psychiatric hospitalizations, I spent the entire time trying to convince people to let me out so I could go back to work. I can think of specific times where I seemed destined for success and everything was going my way, and my GD mental health & various addictions had other ideas. Of course, we all use our problems as excuses sometimes, but most of the time I just desperately want to be normal.",

Then, whatever church he was involved with rejected him. He became depressed over that. Another normal response to such a rejection. Then another failed romance. More depression. Again, a normal reaction. Who wouldn't be depressed over all of this? Why is this \"mental illness\"? \n\nThen, if he supposedly was religious of some sort, why was he living with a prostitute? Was he simply staying there, or was there a relationship? If there was fornicating with a prostitute, who knows what diseases she may have had? Could that have been a factor? Whatever the relationship, it was his choice to live with this woman. Then he started drinking absinthe. Whose fault is that? He CHOSE to do that. Obviously, that's going to mess with your mind. \n\nAgain, why is any of this  \"mental illness\"? Seems like he created some of his own problems. But his life is romanticized in this way. What is the evidence that he \"found the peace he longed for\" after he died? The Bible teaches we die once and then comes judgment. Is there any evidence he had ever repented and received Christ as savior? If not, dead is not rest. It's everlasting damnation. I find that horrifying. \n\nPeople need to stop making him into a completely helpless victim. He was not. He may have had his problems, like everyone else does. Maybe some were physical. But he also made CHOICES. And he will be held accountable for them before Christ one day. If someone did murder him, then so will they.\n\nPoor Theo van Gogh. He should be the real hero here. He supported this brother who couldn't get along with anyone and who apparently didn't want to work. But, of course, no one cares about him.",

His mental illness, not understood or effectively treated is another tragedy of his life - and I would never wish such suffering on any person, but part of me wonders: would he have been the brilliant, iconoclastic painter he was, without the loneliness, illness, failures? Would his paintings fetch some of the highest prices ever paid, if not for having suffered through the life he did? Would he be the towering unique genius without all that created & twisted him? Would we talk about Vincent Van Gogh at all, if he'd been better adjusted - more like Theo?",

I remember watching Robert Altman's film Vincent & Theo, and in the suicide scene, Van Gogh walks out into field, pulls out a gun, jabs it into his side and pulls the trigger. I assumed that Altman had researched how he had been shot and that a mentally ill man like Van Gogh would have acted impulsively and ineffectively, and not really known how to kill himself. Like someone who just takes a whole bottle of pills instead of taking just enough to do the job, and instead of dying, they throw up the pills. Maybe he thought, if I die, I die, but if this doesn‚Äôt kill me, back to painting?\nIf I talk about this any further, I'm going to sound like the dope I am. So, thanks.",

                    "text": "It's hard to say if Van Gogh killed himself or if it was an accident he tried to shield his accidental killers of, but I have to say it's hard to trust after-the-fact ballistics. Most cases involve people that do not believe Van Gogh killed himself trying to prove prior held bias. It's difficult for some people to believe that a talented individual would suddenly commit to such a deed with little early warning and when things were calming down, or that he would experience regret after the fact. As someone who lost a friend to this, and from accounts I've heard or read of it, typically people do not plan their suicide, it's a sudden decision typically brought on by extreme emotion.\n\nHis things getting lost isn't that difficult to explain, nor the gun. This wasn't modern day Europe, it was 1800s France in a small town. It was several miles of unkempt wilderness and fields. If there wasn't a large, dedicated search set up, it would take at most a few weeks for his possessions to become permanently lost and the same goes for any blood. Even nowadays, with far better equipment, understanding, and a far larger population and thus more manpower for searches, we can struggle to find what otherwise might appear obvious in smaller areas.\n\nIf the bullet got stuck inside of him, it'd point to it likely having been a flintlock, so the account of a revolver may have just been misconception. A flintlock pistol wouldn't have been very hard to get your hands on in 1800s France, and Van Gogh might've gotten it while he was in Paris. It could've also have been an accidental shooting, not a suicide attempt. He may have prepped it and, without thinking, attempted to holster it or draw it and accidentally discharged it - this happens even today. Even if you were to point to the lack of a powder burn, this could've merely been human error. It would not be far out to suggest the doctor may have merely forgotten; or that it could also be the reddened skin that he mentioned; alternatively he may have not mentioned it purely because of Van Gogh admitting to having shot himself, why state the obvious?\n\nUltimately, it's impossible to say what really happened, but I feel like this tight grip on the 'it couldn't have been suicide' is a general fear of how unpredictable people can ultimately be. I really do not think there's more here than people wanting to believe there to be more.",

Van Gogh's charitable heart might have sympathized and he did not want this poor crazy person hurt by authorities.",

He has shared with and is shared by so many. In moments of elation in relationship to his work I am God grateful for bringing forth such life as was given in the form of van Gogh. Perhaps at a quick glance one could call him a martyr of art, though in reality no martyr need truly suffer, even though there seems no other way. If only things had been different for him. I just hope he knew that no virtue goes truely unrewarded even after what one calls death. \nA beautiful video once again Horses, thank you.",

There is no one specific case for everyone & everyone‚Äôs experience with these disorders are different.\n\nPlease do not watch this video & say ‚Äúoh I guess I‚Äôm bipolar now‚Äù - that was not my intention. My intention was to express what I was feeling when I got the diagnosis & to see if other people may have been experiencing the same thing.\n\nYes, these could be symptoms, but it all depends on you and your life. I was at a place where these things were heavily affecting my everyday life to the point where I was not able to function. If that is not you, then you‚Äôre good! üòä",

I was severely depressed and was sent to a mental hospital who put me on abilify without consulting my parents and when my mom tried to talk to the doctor he wouldn‚Äôt tell her anything, just that i would be starting some new medications and that i was doing a lot better. 4 years and 150 lbs later I was diagnosed as pre diabetic because for some individuals who take abilify, the Ghrelin and Leptin in their stomach stops working and stops being created. This is not talked about enough! I was 15 years old and pre diabetic because of abilify because i was always hungry (no leptin or ghrelin) and i thought i was doing something wrong. i didn‚Äôt realize it was because of my medication. before starting or stopping any medications do your research!!! abilify changed my life for the worse and caused so many more mental health issues than i started with. (also side note that mental hospital was ass and because of their actions i could be dead if i dint persistently tell my mom that something wasn‚Äôt right, also i am not bipolar and didn‚Äôt need to be on abilify in the first place)",

And have to start all over again. It makes you have this like inching fear it'll happen again, and dating is irresponsible because nobody wants that kinda burden. Then everyone tells you your emotions aren't real, cause bipolar is just the brain firing emotions crazy like. So everyone around you, gets to feel happy or get mad, or get sad, they can be mean, and aggressive but you can't set boundaries because people look at you like oh you're just feeling a random emotion its not a big deal. It really leaves you with a feeling of feeling like you don't matter. Or at least thats how it makes me feel.",

A lot of those are traits of someone who cares it's just the difference of how much it affects you. Having reactions shouldn't be being bi polar. If someone says something funny I'm going to laugh, if they say something mean I'll be upset. It's bi polar when you go through all those emotions with little to no reason for it. The people who cry and don't know why their crying type of thing. I feel like their trying to make empaths a disorder cause they want to make the masses less empathetic and more numb to what's right and having feelings.",

And firstly your sexual pleasure. If you investigate your manic situations you find that all of them are because of sexual affairs those fascinate you too much. \n\nBut as a 33 years old male I comfortably can say that the ultimate hell is here. And the gate of this hell is sexual organs.\n\nPsychiatric drugs are just sexual lobotomy cehemicals actually but most psychiatric patients deserve them. \n\nAnd it is because of their imbecileness like me. \n\nReduce your sexual pleasure by drugs and ne patient. You will see the ultimate truth by aging. Everything runs around sex people do all the betrayal slyness fraudness devilish for sexual pleasure and you are too much naive and silly to understand that.",

Most people with actual bipolar have periods of stability, and they tend to have longer periods of stability or depression compared to mania/hypomania. Mania is very apparent and isn't very sustainable, while hypomania can be less obvious to others, but not necessarily less destructive. \n\nThe shit he has in the video are personality traits and that's according to the DSM-V not to me. \n\nHaving more than 4 episodes a year is called rapid cycling, which isn't that common. So if someone's mood changes throughout the day, it's not really indicative of bipolar disorder. They must be distinctive episodes, not happening at the same time or based on how your day is going so far lol.\n\nUf your psychiatrist diagnosed you with bipolar disorder when you don't have this episodic pattern, then I recommend you get a second opinion. If you, like the guy in the video, was told that those are symptoms of bipolar disorder, then you're really should get a second opinion. \n\nI always say shitty behavior because of wrong personal beliefs or bad habits, isn't really a sign of mental illness, or personality disorder either, in many cases. You should definitely get checked out by a professional still and not self-diagnose from TikTok videos. \n\nIt's wild that you were led to belive these are symptoms of bipolar disorder. I hope you're doing well now, and that your psychiatrist took into account more than what you mentioned here to diagnose you",

For example, I think I'm a generally optimistic person but anxiety and depression make me overthink about everything.

Im not here to say I know EXACTLY how you feel because bipoler disorder impacts others differently. But I thought I should shear my story with you.  I have been struggling with bipoler disorder my whole life and I know this because I was originally diagnosed with childhood bipolar disorder when I was 3 years old and i was put on Lithium  it made me hallucinat so my mom had them take me off Lithium and got a second opinion on my diagnosis and of course diagnosing childhood bipolar disorder is rather difficult so the second doctor told my mom I didn't have bipolar disorder and that I was just \"a typical kid\" who had behavior problems..so for 16 years I've been living with childhood bipolar disorder untreated until I had my first massive manic episode at 18 but wasn't officially diagnosed until 19 because I ran away from home during my manic episode and didn't come back for 6 months...when I finally returned home my mom took me to a psychiatrist after my 19th birthday and they first tested me for schizophrenia because bipolar disorder and schizophrenia link together along with autism which I also have mild autism...I'm now taking abilify and it has been the best medication for me so far but like most meds it has its limits I still struggle with mood fluctuations but not as bad as it used to be. But as far as how I felt when I was officially diagnosed at 19 I felt so low of myself worried about what other people would think..my self-esteem was extremely low for the longest time and im still stuggling with my self-esteem but I try to keep in mind that it doesn't matter what other people think..because this is who i am and who I will forever be and there is nothing I or anyone can do to change it and if there are people who don't accept me because I'm labeled \"crazy\" then that's their problem because I can't help being bipolar no one can help it it's something you are born with. So you are not alone and I hope you find the right medication for you that will best benefit you in the long run being bipolar is no joke and it is hard to live with.",

As a health care provider, with the passage of time, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and self-esteem issues are becoming less and less specific to mental health conditions and more and more typical of human nature--unfortunately. What separates bipolar disorder from these things is the significant up and down swings in emotional lability, and the length of time spent dwelling in those highs and lows. In today's world, we have much more specific diagnostic criteria...though, arguably, the DSM V is outdated and could definitely use a nice update.",

They do more harm than good and are a scam from pharmaceutical companies trying to trick people into becoming addicted to the meds so they can profit billions of money. It's the TRUTH. They've brainwashed well-meaning talented psychiatrists (and other health workers) with false unethical guidelines. The mental health meds can be amazing sometimes as well, I know someone who has severe psychosis (hearing voices) and he said his medication reduced the voices so it's helped him so much. But they're way over-prescribed. Anti-depressants are a scam and so are 'mood stabilizers'. You can't fix high-sensitivity and bipolar. There are usually other more effective and less risky ways to manage symptoms.",

                    "text": "Chasing diagnosis are a distraction to purposely avoid looking and beginning the true healing. no need to label someone as schizophrenic or bipolar or anything in that regard, all of that is just maladaptive responses to Childhood trauma and neglect. Something as simple as a parent not defending you consistently creates trauma in a child and that gets carried into adulthood and morphs us into being that we were not intended to be. If a parent cannot provide a solid stable consistent emotionally balanced Foundation within themselves, within the home and outside the home for the child to thrive and feel safe, we have experienced emotional neglect. People have no idea how deep that goes and how it has shaped us into who we are. We are accountable for providing ourselves with whatever our parents could not provide us because they themselves have not done their healing from their childhood neglect and Trauma and wounding. If we have low self-esteem it's because our parents did not provide a solid example that was consistent, parents have no idea that the energy they give off is what the child responds to, not their words but definitely also their actions. The energy of all that is hidden within a parent who has their own internal issues is what that child is sensitive to.‚ù§ stay out of big farm in the medical system because all the side effects of those pills will create exactly what you are taking them initially for. The answers are not in big pharma. The body needs to heal itself and dealing with the repressed emotions and wounding is how you can eradicate and heal the illnesses in the body including physical illness., children are extremely intuitive High vibrational light beings, and they sense things parents could have no idea about. parents put on a wonderful show because typically they are not often completely authentic genuine and transparently honest at all times. That will fragment any child.üò¢ no matter how good their intentions are, if they had not done their own inner healing and Shadow work , the next generation is impacted. \n\nThe term bipolar is utilized just like any other label in the medical field to slap different drugs into people. Because the side effects are what the medical system is designed to actually promote, to keep you in that system and making the system money. The goal is not to eradicate the root cause. Then they lose customers. The more we look for care and concern or a validation or accolades or unconditional love outside of our self, the more we have outsourced our power, and we already have all of it.... Within us.üòä look within versus externally and focus on the self because it is self-preservation and the most healing thing you could do for the World by putting yourself first, becoming your own best friend, loving alone time with yourself and healthy ways, and providing daily self-care and self-love routines by following what you love to do as a child, that is where your abundance lies. Can only work from the inside out.‚ù§\n\nSo you've identified all these issues in this video and ask why they're there? They're not supposed to be there because the body is designed to be in the moment and at peace. How can you create balance in your life? How can you practice cultivating and honing trust in yourself, your intuition and your sense of self that was never allowed to be created properly in childhood, perhaps you were parentified, had immature parents or ones that inappropriately spoke about things that never should be spoken about in front of a child. When we can see our parents as the truly flawed individuals that they are and the family system as dysfunctional as we didn't realize it was, which does not negate any of the other things that we wanted to focus on that appeared to be good or happy or healthy..... then you are seeing the whole picture. But first and foremost, we must Unconditionally Love all the parts of ourselves without judgment. What you are experiencing externally is a reflection of what's going on internally. Everything is projected and is a mirror back to us as to what we can heal within ourselves.‚ù§ if you are not being hated and you don't have to tractors and you are doing something wrong. But being overly focused on the world around you is a distraction from doing that inner healing.",

Now I‚Äôm stable more often than not and I still get episodes but not to the extremes we normally feel them. \nMore ppl have bi polar than you know. It‚Äôs hard to get properly diagnosed with bipolar. Most times if you actually go to the phyc ward you are having a break of some sort or I had to go while switching between meds a couple times. But most of the time most docs there basically abt 2 hr max. Depending on how many patients they have. You don‚Äôt get more than 10 min if you‚Äôre lucky with him/her.\nThere are many things that go into getting the proper diagnosis. Most of the time a lot of ppl come out with a diagnosis of depression. Well from what I understand to put a person with bipolar on just an antidepressant it makes our mania worse. Then it starts a nasty cycle. Your meds will make you feel like crap (side effects) sometimes but plz talk to your doc about changing it. But whatever you do DO NOT stop taking your meds. Even when you feel better. You feel better cuz of the meds. And every time you stop you have to start ALL over as though from the beginning.  If you feel that you or someone you know have these symptoms contact the local hospital for a directory of the phyc docs in the area.",

I had been misdiagnosed with anxiety and severe depression by my GP and was prescribed medications to treat those conditions, which made my bipolar disorder SIGNIFICANTLY worse. I had been on a wait list to see a psychiatrist for over a year at that point, my mental health kept declining until I woke up one day and just decided ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done‚Äù. I cleaned my room top to bottom, removed all the art from my walls, I packed all my clothes from my dresser and closet into black trash bags, I packed all the books on my shelves into boxes along with everything else. I took the sheets and blankets and pillow cases off my bed and washed them, dried them and folded them and put them in the trash bags too. I stacked all the boxes and bags in my closet. My Dad thought maybe I was just reorganizing my bedroom, as he was leaving the house to run an errand I hugged him and told him I loved him, and then I went to the upstairs bathroom, locked the door, I took a large quantity of a specific substance and took a bath, it was 3 pm. \n\nI‚Äôm not going to go into all the details, but my Dad got hit with ‚Äúa really bad feeling‚Äù when he was about two blocks away from the house, he turned around and came home. I woke up in a hospital about two weeks later, I had been in a medically induced coma. I was finally moved up the waiting list and was paired with a psychiatrist, and after some testing I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder. It took a long time to figure out the right meds and the correct dosages, and I had slip ups, and some in patient stays, but I haven‚Äôt had a significant manic or depressive episode(or even really mood swings) since 2012. It took allot of work, allot of patience, allot of consistency, allot of trust, allot of love, allot of sheer will to get to where I am today, but it was worth it.",

There is no one specific case for everyone & everyone‚Äôs experience with these disorders are different.\n\nPlease do not watch this video & say ‚Äúoh I guess I‚Äôm bipolar now‚Äù - that was not my intention. My intention was to express what I was feeling when I got the diagnosis & to see if other people may have been experiencing the same thing.\n\nYes, these could be symptoms, but it all depends on you and your life.

This is not talked about enough! I was 15 years old and pre diabetic because of abilify because i was always hungry (no leptin or ghrelin) and i thought i was doing something wrong. i didn‚Äôt realize it was because of my medication. before starting or stopping any medications do your research!!! abilify changed my life for the worse and caused so many more mental health issues than i started with. (also side note that mental hospital was ass and because of their actions i could be dead if i dint persistently tell my mom that something wasn‚Äôt right, also i am not bipolar and didn‚Äôt need to be on abilify in the first place)",

I couldn‚Äôt relate to that because GAD does not have such strong highs and lows like bipolar disorder. So yes there are some symptoms that are the same but they are not the same condition.",

Its not as if you do a few rounds of some therapy, take a round of anti depressants, and then youre cured and can stop.  It's a lifelong illness, that requires a lifetime of treatment.   I'm not trying to be offensive- just truthful. üëç.     (My mother is severely bipolar, my brother was schizophrenic. So. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.)  It's nothing personal against you!!üëçü´∂.   It's dangerous to say that it can \"go away\"...... because it's very common for people with bipolar to stop taking their meds when they \"feel a little better\", and then they spiral again. They think they don't need the meds anymore- but they really do.    So.  I'm just sayin!!!!  It is VERY dangerous for them, and for the people around them, to say that it \"goes away\"... bc it can encourage them that theyre fine now, and dont need anymore help. Its incredibly dangerous.

I have MANY diagnoses including bipolar disorder, which is why I‚Äôm speaking up. I want people to be aware of these mental illnesses and learn that they are not something to take lightly.\n\nMental illness is very crippling for many people with actual anxiety, bipolar disorder, adhd, depression, ptsd, ocd, did, autism, etc. It is not a joke and should stop being thrown around like a joke. It is very angering to see that people are using these terms so lightly, making it seem like it‚Äôs nothing while we actually suffer badly.",

The most telling sign ( in my most unprofessional opinion) is how others around a bipolar person are treated...especially those closest  to them.  They're always deflecting and feeling shame and tend to direct it at anyone close. \nThey can't can't control their rage at a particular person (even when they're clearly in the wrong). That's the big one. Being on the other end of this deflection and rage really hurts.. if anyone's noticing that others are scared of them or tired around them...that could be more helpful in beginning to recognise other symptoms. The guilt and rage gwt worse and worse if unmanaged.  Never base your diagnosis on advice online though..always go to a doctor. Always get professional and medical opinions. All best.",

Many borderlines are misdiagnosed as bipolar, unfortunately- or as cptsd in men- which is a whole other sexist rant I could get into, but I digress.\nAs someone with bpd, the rage is more intense than other people realize. It burns you from the inside out- it consumes you. And it is taken out on those closest to us. Generally our fp, or favorite person. We put them on a pedestal, and when they inevitably fall from it in our eyes (who wouldn't, it's not fair to expect perfection of course!), we switch completely to anger at them. It very much sounds like you were dealing with a borderline.\nJust want to add that we are demonized online and in rhe mental health community in many ways, so I hope no one takes this comment as more of that. We can be incredible humans, we love deeply and its far more common for bpd people to be abused, than to be abusive. But, we can absolutely be terrible at times, and its our responsibility to recognize and work on this.",

Here im probably just bipolar, which suddenly makes alot of sense and explains the mania, and really bad lows. Thanks so much man. I never really thought about wether I could be bipolar because the symptoms I have line up with my other diagnose, so I never questioned it. I just been bouncing from one anti depressant to another, trying all sorts of med changes because every one im switched to just always make things 100x worse. Dude seriously, thank you. Maybe I can get things under control now after I bring this up to my doctor.",

Most people with bipolar cannot take any SSRI because it makes us manic. So like, yeah. bipolar is almost more medical than other disorders, in a way, if that makes sense.\n\nGood luck. It's a horrific roller-coaster, but it's better to know earlier and learn how to manage it. Also, luckily, not a choice or a fine line. It's a much more clear cut thing generally, but type I the most. So yeah. Wishing you well, be safe, and take good care.",

Also,these symptoms may sometimes show up due to the presence of some other comorbid disorders and not bipolar in its actual form. So stop self-diagnosis and go get some real help if u feel that the conditions are worsening . Otherwise, if in spite of having symptoms of a disorder, u can perform your daily tasks efficiently, it proves that everything is quite normal out there.",

Nothing has to happen and usually doesn‚Äôt , for me to lay in bed for WEEKS to months . The worst things could happen and I‚Äôll be giggling through them feeling like a superhero. Also I‚Äôve noticed many people with PDs call themselves empaths or says they feel others emotions. Do you really or are you projecting what you think they feel ? Many ppl with Bipolar are misdiagnosed ~ rapid cycling is another name for ‚Äú you prob have  bpd‚Äù. All my bipolar folks here can relate to going to bed after a week of being productive, social, hyper, paranoid, reckless and impulsive and waking up depressed as fuck and unable to exist for weeeeeks-months, forgetting all the times they felt happy, ghosting their friends, laying in bed , crying without reason-literally just crying when things are objectively good or fine, and feeling as though the pressure of the world is immobilizing their body. Sooo, with that being said, I don‚Äôt know you , I just want people to get proper help. It‚Äôs always best to have a psychiatrist diagnose you .. log your moods as well. If you see a long trend of the same highs and lows , weeks - months of being normal with no symptoms, you‚Äôre prob bipolar.",

The real indication is how many people they've hurt or brought into their pain...how many others they've blamed because they can't comprehend the emotions. It's very important  to get diagnosed properly...most won't. Why do I have this opinion? Being with someone with unmanaged bipolar was utterly life destroying.

I have ADHD and I could copy the text exactly but replace bipolar with ADHD and I'll get a ton of ADHDers relating and resonating. I don't think the way he's formulated these points communicates well what about his experience with these traits is linked to or caused by bipolar to people who don't have bipolar. But maybe that wasn't the intent of the short anyway? Maybe it was just meant to be enjoyed by people who have bipolar and already understand their condition to a certain extend?",

Take happiness and sadness for example: everyone does at time feel one or the other of this feeling. When you have bipolar it is way out of proportion it is a chemical imbalance in the brain and when your ‚Äúhappy‚Äù it is SO intense. Like you may as well be on meth or cocaine bc your really talkative and excited and so much motivation, barely sleeping no need to eat food. However, on the flip side‚Ä¶ when you are sad‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just feeling a bit hurt or crying. It feels like yo u just found out your whole family has been mass murdered, like your chest is being concaved in and your heart physically hurts. The smallest bits of criticism you hear will send you deeper and darker into an unwanted place. Maybe you will start fantasizing about all the ways you could off yourself. And sure maybe other disorders (major depressive disorder) has this. But the difference from different disorders and bipolar is literally that ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù meaning TWO polar opposites. You have EXTREME highs (mania/hyper mania) and EXTREME lows (depressive). There is two different types of it as well type 1 and type 2. You can feel the extreme highs for a day to months at a time and then have extreme lows right after. \n\nSure, some might be a little vague and for anyone reading this never self-diagnose. Do your own research though and do tests and if you really feel like a disorder is impacting your daily life and affecting your work or relationships, please go visit your family doctor and literally give them situations that have happened, symptoms and proof on why you think you may have something and they will guide you in the right direction.",

If this man had bipolar he most definitely would have stated that he experienced mania or hypomania!!! EDUCATE YOURSELVES BEFORE SELF DIAGNOSING.",

Our thoughts have a literal physical expression in our physical brains. It's not ALL spiritual.\n\nAlso, if you think it is, how do you know what? Please introspect. This is not what the bible teaches. The bible doesn't teach that every mental thing is a spiritual thing. Infact it teaches there's both spiritual reasons and \"the flesh\" as a reason.\n\nI've been Christian my whole life. The world is comlex, life is complex, and the enemy in the spiritual is trying to make things even more complex and confusing than they already are. We experience physical mental illness and the enemy uses that as a vulnerability and attacks us spiritually too so we deal with both. But when you take care of the spiritual you still have the physical to deal with. And sometimes it's only the physical and sometimes it's only the spiritual.\n\nFor about a year I struggled with depressive phases which only got more frequent, longer and more intense overtime. I completely got rid of those and very quickly at that through just solely spiritual warfare. So that was only spiritual. I have ADHD, ADHD is not inherently an illness or \"bad\" but it can cause a lot of issues if a person doesn't know they have it, doesn't understand it, doesn't manage it appropriately. All of the ADHD issues I had and still have are just physical. There's nothing spiritual about it. Yes, God still helps with those things which are only physical and He's helped me with ADHD issues too. He's a God of the physical and of the spiritual, not just one or the other. But it's important to know there is a distinction between the two. They can br connected and they are connected but they are still distinct and failing to recognize thay and built a basic understanding of that is highly likely to cause you to mismange your own health or harm others, or even abuse others. And fail to solve problems, both problems based in the physical and in the spiritual.\n\nI would say my issues with stress are an example of the physical and the spiritual mixing.\n\nSo I dare say I've experienced all three versions - something that was quasi only spiritual, something that was only physical and something that was mixed.\n\nThere is an entire book in the bible dedicated to wisdom. God definitely values wisdom and emphasizes how important wisdom is for us humans. I believe God delights in the work all types of doctors do because it's a work of love.",

Without them you do not have bipolar. You must experience atleast one mania to be properly diagnosed with bipolar. (This is a fact you can look it up) A lot of people think ‚Äúoh no I‚Äôm experiencing being happy and then sad through out the day I must be bipolar!‚Äù They have no idea how truly bad it is and what other symptoms come with it. It frustrates me that this mental illness isn‚Äôt taught or focused on more. Everyone is accepting and understands depression and anxiety but when it comes to bipolar people don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs just as bad as schizophrenia (when you have bipolar type 1 in some cases) it‚Äôs such an awful mental disorder that you cannot just live with. So a lot of ppl self diagnose or get misdiagnosed and it‚Äôs frustrating!!!",

Human emotions do not live in the common 3d world.They live in a world much harder to express to our common 3d world than just simple thought.Thought has been created by society over thousands of years in order to better survive, reproduce and make pleasures. It is no more our reality than our emotions. Thus, always the struggle to create the emotional world reflected into the 3d world so others may find the same pleasures or sometimes abominations.\n\n It is a complicated crossover to try and communicate a world that society created into the minds to be more simplified world and existence. \"Seeing\" in the arts, has greater meaning than simple visual. The art of communicating greater values and information that the socially created world left out for simplicity purposes and of coarse capital gain on others.",

I literally feel the pain as if it were my own. The nail pierced my own flesh. I hit my own head on the table. My imagination is just too strong. I can't help but imagine it. Then I grow faint.

That's why we've seen many poets and writers; musicians and painters with this disorder throught history. Mental illness is not always a condition for being creative, but madness and brilliance always go hand in hand since ancient times. Actually, I read that even good writers that are not mentally ill, enter temporary manic states when they're writing a novel. I find this subject truly fascinating and I'm very happy that arts have always been there to comfort sad and solitary souls.",

I bought paint and canvases and tried to explain it to other people, mostly my grandma.  Words fail sometimes.  My painting (icon) is called, \"Religion.\"  It can be a caveman,  Plato's Cave, Jewish, Pagan, waves or birds, eternity or lies, the apple of Eden, and, when turned upside down becomes the devil with the fruit of an evil womb.  The yellow sun looks up or down.  Please excuse my poor art skills.",

Today I think art is used in nefarious ways, though, with hidden meanings and, well, the paramount being largely on the monetary.  We no longer just love paintings, etc. b/c of what we see, but what we are told to see and how to interpret it.  For some, performance art is also a huge super ego function, whereby they believe they are a conduit for mediums or other things, but I'm suggesting it comes from a selfish intention if you have power and from a caged one (being controlled) if not.  Art neither the artist is something to be worshipped neither to be indistinguishable from objectivity or to serve a specific cause, but that is what it seems to have turned into - both to society and the underpinnings of it.  It's harder to trust, therefore, harder to appreciat.",

The problem tho is this, most people don't have proper guidance to a maintain a healthy mind. It takes time to unlearn chronic sadness or pain. Drugs help some people get a head start. Also drugs have a placebo effect on people who believe it will work for them... so it helps. If you are denying that people suffer chronically, then u are wrong.",

It's easy to depict and show because you feel it so strongly. I find it easier to create when I'm emotional and typically, I can only show sadness because I have the time and the emotions right there. When I'm depressed, I retreat away from people give me time and space to make something. When I'm happy I want to spread my happiness with others quickly, before it passes, so I don't create anything. \n\nIdk if that makes sense. Its 4:36 am and this video really made me think about that.",

They had no morals and if psychopaths grow up in environments that don't show high moral values they can become violent and manipulative. Most time they aren't violent but in cases like those movie characters if they aren't given what they tried to manipulate to get in the first place they may resort to violence. Psychopaths don't have morals and so when they are raised in places of neglect or arent show what is right and wrong, they will do things impulsively out of curiosity or maybe it pleases them, or even just because they want to and have the ability to do so. They are unable to empathize with emotion. So they don't naturally know that things hurt people and there is wrong and right. Schizophrenia is completely opposite. It can come and go randomly, it can completely trap your mind in your own body essentially freezing you, it can warp your sense of reality, or all of these at once, and much more. But most of the time they are not violent and not manipulative at all.",

When you deal with these feelings daily, possibly for your entire life, you have a lot of time to ponder negative thoughts. At times, they are consuming, so of course my art would reflect that. Also, painting is my way of releasing these feelings. It feels easier than doing so in words or conversation (usually, lol!)",

The fact that artists are usually very sensitive people who notice everything and see things from a deep perspective and experience emotions on another level and 2. Artists are constantly thinking very deeply and there are always thoughts and images running through an artists mind therefore it makes it hard to get away from painful thoughts. I believe that artists simply over think because they usually have a high intelligence that can only be expressed through their art which in turn causes them to be misunderstood and depressed. Not to mention most artists are perfectionists and become highly upset when their work etc isn't coming out the way they envision it which also can cause depression and self loathing.",

They can use it in art and express their feelings through it, even as a therapy to overcome bad things. If you look closely, in the paintings you can see some details that reveal \"disturbing\" things in the artist's mind. Van Gogh is a perfect example. In other cases, it's very explicit, like Frida Kahlo. In music, you can notice it in the lyrics or the sound. Something alike happens with literature, or even scenic arts; the body language. Every artist's mind is a maze, basically. Sometimes they find the exit easily, sometimes not.",

Not the conformance to any given \"Live Like This\" script. In terms of the gamut of human cognition, this is that far from normality that it doesn't even rate a mention in the scope of creative reality. And I am prone to thinking now, that the poster of this video may have some connection to the mental health industry and or the drug companies that espouse a \"Proverbial\" cure. People are what people are. And we should never be pigeon holed in to any given systems of nomenclature and labelling. What rubbish.",

And eventually there‚Äôs no one left cause they fucked up all of their relationships with their manic episodes. I really feel for them. It must be awful to not feel in control of your life. Only alternative is to go on medication that sucks out their soul and dims their light and removes not just the bad parts but all the good and creative and interesting parts of their personality as well. They just end up being a shell of themselves. I heard it gets better when they get older though, like 60‚Äôs, if they make it that far.",

The ways I was hurting myself and others. Forced me to go inward and I was able to realise a lot and become someone who takes accountability for my actions and the effect they have. It was when I began to realise that no matter what I did, I was not well mentally. I was, in truth, mentally ill. So I sought help. \nMental illness explains why a person acts a certain way, but it is not an excuse for hurting others carelessly.",

You can accept your diagnosis without using it as an excuse to hurt people. Also, newsflash: until you accept your diagnosis and start treating it, you are going to keep hurting people. And not on purpose. It‚Äôs involuntary. \n\nNo one should be setting the precedent that people with untreated mental illness have the ability to control their thinking and behaviors. You control it through treatment and developing insight. Some would argue the only way to take full responsibility and prevent hurting other people is to get on board with treating your illness ASAP. \n\nPeople who accepted their mental illness early on and started treating it are typically further along in that process, not falling behind.

I just think as someone who is putting out content to educate people about the bipolar section of the mental health community it‚Äôs incredibly irresponsible to lump 1 and 2 together. You could have separated 1 and 2 and the video still been the same length with all the same information when they are so very very different. Bipolar 2 doesn‚Äôt experience mania. We experience hypomania which is so completely different. The way we think and respond are completely different. The severeness of the  impulsivity is also vastly different. I‚Äôm not disagreeing I‚Äôm just saying man. If you‚Äôre gonna represent at least have the curtesy to not do what everyone else does and lump them together like they are the same. That‚Äôs like saying adhd and bipolar are the same. They have similar characteristics but are very much not the same.",

If you haven't experienced at LEAST a full consecutive 7 days of mania that wasn't drug induced, then it's not type 1. Bipolar II is frequently diagnosed in people who actually have BPD,  because of the impulsivity, shifts in mood/irritability and up and down energy. The difference is that a hypomanic episode is a consistent episode for at least 4 days, while BPD are the folks who seem to change every hour. Please stop using bipolar (and self diagnosed PTSD) as some way to justify your selfishness, overall instability, mood swings, self harm and self destructive behaviors.",

The statistics bear this out. \n\nPeople like me who have this disorder have a responsibility to educate themselves and speak candidly but carefully in public.

                    "text": "It's hard not to succumb into the overwhelming force your bipolar mind/body makes you go through. I was a ticking time bomb and always questioned why in rage/frustration, now that I know what to watch out for, I take steps when the highs and lows hit. Sometimes, I want to scream and rip myself out of my body during my lows but I soldier through it until it passes... while I spend my excessive energy on my highs but makes sure to keep myself in check. It's severely exhausting mentally, physically and spiritually. There's no way I can keep this up till old age, all this stress and active fight or flight will kill me before I hit 60. I'm not sure if I should be glad I've got type 2, since I went through a full blown psychosis like type 1... I really feel for people with type 1. \n\nUpdate: To all my sisters and brothers, turn to Christ and He will give you rest. [Matthew 11:28-30 NIV] \"Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\" Look at the creatures and even the stones all around you, they seem to know what to do and live but why are we lost? They all praise GOD, turn to Christ and He will give you foundation. [John 14:6 NIV] \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"",

                            "text": "I am diagnosed type 2, I thought people couldn't have psychosis if they have type 2? I mean I'll have rapid cycling mania and depression that lasts for a week depression, week mania, etc. but if I don't stay on top of my sleep schedule, I can become really crazy. Like I can't even recognize myself. One time I thought my best friend was stalking me, but she literally wasn't. Another time I thought animal abuse was an orange. Like really freaky stuff. Is this really type 2 or is it type 1?\n\nI am diagnosed type 2.\nAnyways my experience with the highs is, Sometimes, I think I can do anything, I talk to everyone in sight, my heart beats a mile a minute, I think I am invincible, make a lot of friends, create a whole bunch of stuff with my hands, take on way too many things to do. It's not that I'm incapable of shame during this faze, but rather that my brain can't focus enough to process, it's whirring a mile a minute. \n\n IF it goes on too long, I get paranoid, and explode to everyone around me, preaching, screaming, crying, etc. I'll get the restlessness and unable to think like euphoric mania. I'll also get shivers, rant at everyone even blank walls, and have paranoid emotional explosions. Usually they're directed about something. I've had one where it was about nothing at all, and I couldn't stop, and I didn't understand why it was happening. So I would say the explosions are a combination of what I am afraid of happening, and mania, and depression at the same time. Usually when this happens I can't speak normally, words don't form correctly. \nI think this stage is like a nightmare where all of the logic is gone from your brain, all that's left is just the fear and pain. Because the euphoria has left, but everything else from mania is still there. \n\n Then my lows look like catatonic major depression where I can't move.\n\nThe thing is though all of this can be manageable, the most important thing is me recognizing that I am manic before I cause damage. I made a personalized quiz for myself that I take every day, to tell if I'm manic. I also take it if I'm wondering if I'm manic or the second stage. If I am manic, I take a trazodone and sleep it off, and avoid people so that I don't react paranoid to a \"fear\" or something, or explode at someone and regret it. Exercise, avoiding caffeine, and eating regularly is something you should do all of the time to prevent mania. Anyways, yes I am manic, I looked this vid up to get tips for it. hehe I type a lot when I'm manic. \n\nI'm getting better at managing it, but yeah it sucks. :)",

It also stemmed from depersonalization; I was having mild audio and visual hallucinations, didn't know what was real anymore but I was dealing with other issues before my first major crash. I can't tell you since mental conditions are complex and many people often get misdiagnosed, but I do know BP2 gets more depressive cycles... which is what I'm dealing with.

I didn't know what to do. I put my clothes back on and sat next to her, we remained in profound silence for about 20 minutes. Out of nowhere, I felt her caressing my back and kissing me, calling me affectionate names and wanting to have sex. It was a very traumatic experience dating her, friend.

As a good faith measure we can assume this lady just failed to mention that she was specifically talking about mania but that is a big distinction.  \n\nI can only speak for myself but when I was manic I was only vaguely aware that people might not approve of my actions. I would justify things so strongly in my head that anybody who disagrees with me must have ulterior motives. So actions I took that looked calloused were often done out of a delusional ignorance. I was never being purposefully malevolent, and if i was doing something unsavory, I would always convince myself that it was actually in the victims best interest. \n\nI do believe that intent matters. Otherwise  I would be a pretty terrible person about a 1/3rd of the time. And that doesn't really make sense to me.",

But your suggestion that he likely had a combination of health issues is very convincing. I'm sure some of his torment would have left him had more people bought his work and supported him.

His utterly clutsy pursuit of women who found him abhorrent makes me laugh. But it's obsessive, and has no basis in reality. His objects (and I do mean \"objects\") of poor Vincent's ardour are more like projected upon statues, not actual people. \nAnd his parents treated him like shit. And yes, this is about a wildly dysfunctional family! Vincent was made the identified patient, or scapegoat who carried the family shame. And yes, if Theo (pronounced \"Tay-o\" drives me nuts when everyone mispronounces the name ü§™), if Theo did not exist, nobody would have ever heard of Vincent van Gogh. Theo was Vincent's bridge to interacting in this society. Judgmentalism was  rife, and especially prevalent in  Protestant Dutch Reform. Sensitive children were likely to be destroyed by the puritanical and evangelical missionizing and pontificating that were the norm.",

Living with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder has been challenging at times but never to the point where I felt I should complain. My situation is well managed by medications monitored by a gifted person/psychiatrist. I am saddened and amazed at how people coped before the science caught up. Both of my children inherited from me, most likely, their own mental health challenges, but like you said in the Van Gogh episode, these do not define us, and I have preached that since we knew what was taking place. Bipolar 1 and BPD. They are doing well and havelarned the do's and dont's just as I have. There is life with mental illness...good lives are being experienced. I thought you might have a look at doing an episode on the tragic, brilliant, John Kennedy Toole, legendary author of the cult masterpiece \"A Confederacy of Dunces\". By far, the funniest and saddest book I've ever read. I believe that your treatment of Toole's short life which ended by suicide, would be celebrated by the countless people who never met him but love him just the same.",

I think the double loss pushed Vincent over the edge but he mostly cut off his ear to get attention from Theo because it was Theo he needed the most and it was Theo's marriage he felt most threatened by. It worked because Theo came running. It shows a slightly cunning side to Vincent's desperation as he knew he had to do something drastic to drag Theo away from a woman he was about to marry and to keep the money coming. I believe he was still capable of calculating in this way even during episodes that he had no memory of the next day. Even serial killers, though seemingly incapable of stopping killing, can still demonstrate extreme cunning and caution even when leaving a body totally destroyed due to the frenzy of their mental state.",

Thank you, Professor. :) They're so well researched, delivered in a direct, calm and engaging way and seem far more documentary-like than so many other channels.I love how well thought out your diagnoses are - basically never committing to one alone and conveying how difficult it is to diagnose when not in person. I feel like so many love to jump on a diagnosis and then block out all other options - I find it infuriating! and can be so much hype to engage the audience (does the opposite for me). At the same time, your approach doesn't come across as wishy washy, but as an expert in their field.\n\nSome artists I would be interested in include: Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Yayoi Kusama, Hundertwasser, Vali Myers, Jim Morrison, Alexander McQueen. Whatever takes your fancy! Tell your son thanks for pushing you to make these! Jajaja. :)",

As I also have to deal with something, I know for sure that painting gave him relieve and joy. In the end this is what matters - how we focus on the things we love and also surround us with people who care without judging. And being grateful for every happy moment.",

In terms of it was like a story that HAD to be told. Selling paintings would have been gratifying in terms of his dependence on his brother. But would they ever have been free of the emotional tie? Would his disorders dissipate? I think it would have made them worse.\nI am sure he was tormented by a number of disorders. But your description of Epilepsy as well as Autism Spectrum disorders both sound good candidates for the list. (only because they are the ones I have experience of) Especially the way he could launch from peace to apparent psychosis then return to painting as if nothing had happened. No expert and I can truly understand why nobody really is. Much respect for all your work here.",

When I taught art, it was always difficult to try to explain Van Gogh's mental illness, especially to middle schoolers who always immediately wanted to know all about the ear removal ( I was teaching art 40 years ago).  Your autism spectrum speculation (not very familiar to the general public back when I was teaching) seems like a good one because it would explain his difficulty with establishing lasting social relationships, with family, colleagues in the work place, art professors, other painters.  When he was trying to be a missionary to the peasants he made more enemies than friends.  I think he was desperate to make friends and felt that hanging out in cafes or around brothels was one way to casually meet up with people, find sitters for portraits among the cafe workers and townspeople like the post master.  I think he was happiest when painting; he was able to forget himself and become one with the act of creation.  Hours pass when absorbed in art work.  I often wonder if Vincent had remained alive for another ten  years whether his work might have been noticed and BOUGHT by patrons.  But Theo died so shortly after Vincent did, that his money stream would have dried up.  I think Van Gogh is such an appealing art figure because of his brilliant use of color and the energy so evident in his work.  Just this evening my husband was reading a headline on his cell phone about the fact that in Starry Night Vincent was painting wind turbulence.  No other artist has done that that I can think of -- maybe in The Raft of the Medusa or some ocean disaster......others think he may have had imperfect eyesight which caused auras to appear around stars and interior lamps and lights, and that he painted those auras as he saw them.   In art classes in public school, we generally focused on four artists each year from grades 6-8.  So our students knew 12 artists in depth by the time they moved on to high school.  Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Andrew Wyeth (we were in the USA), Leonardo, Monet, Seurat, Michelangelo, and others.  I loved teaching those artists and the kids enjoyed it too.  I always hoped that in future years if and when they had the chance to go to Paris, London or Amsterdam, they could visit a world class museum and have some knowledge of what they were looking at.  Thanks again for this.",

What makes an artist is a compulsion to be one. Not insanity. Simply desire. SOMETIMES our issues serve as inspiration. But Van Gogh would have been a great artist with or without his crippling depression. I wish people would stop playing up to the mental illness angle of his work. And his painting were nowhere NEAR as 'DANGEROUS' as Goya's 'Black Paintings'. I am a rather accomplished artist. I've sold my work world-wide. I'm no Van Gogh. But I'm no slouch. I suffer from bi-polar depression. It has no effect on my work. Excuse, let me correct that...I actually DON'T like to work while in the midst of mania or profound sorrow. In my case, it's a hinderance. Just tired of listening to people yammer about tortured artists. There were plenty of completely sane ones whose work I'd rather own....like William Merritt Chase or John Singer Sargent. Van Gogh will ALWAYS have my admiration for his work. His colors and brushstroke are a staple when I reference the impressionists. I just don't care about his personal anguish. He would have painted the sunflowers even if he was the happiest guy on earth. The misunderstood angle is complete and total bullshit. GOOD DAY.",

Van Gogh is not just great for his painting genius but also his struggle as an artist which places him as an outlier in the established order of linear thinking and reactionary conditioning. Sadly, all of the elements and deep solitude of Vincent's life were necessary to imbue his canvas with profound brush strokes. Wouldn't a psychological study of Antonin Artaud take us to interesting viewpoints?",

However, you have not explained how, after his death (and the untimely death of her husband Theo also); Vincent‚Äôs sister-in-law began actively promoting interest in the painter‚Äôs work and, gradually, art galleries and international buyers began to take an interest - his genius at last being (posthumously) recognised; so that by the twentieth century his works became PRICELESS as they still are. If only he had lived to see that!",

His nutty daughters proved his problems probably had a genetic component....associating with jews wouldnt have helped as theyre renown for having a disproportionate incidence of loony-toonism within their ranks.\n\n  It would be great to have an analysis of Sir Richard Burton the explorer....his Catholic wife burnt alot of his papers.She may have been a Catholic Marrano?.",

I was thinking about the causes for mania and the \"supressed ulcer\", I think you are taking this as being a stomach ulcer and in my opinion, they may well be talking about a skin ulcer like leg ulceration, which could, if not attended to, cause blood poisoning or at least a reaction to a septic ulcer which could cause delerium and other mental symptoms due to high fever and toxins in the system. I saw my sister have a terrible reaction to a vaccine before going on a trip with my marine engineer father, which required us to be vaccinated for Africa, South America and other places (we circumnavigated the world). Even though I was 15 at the time and ran away as soon as the GP next door took her in hand, she was screaming,  bashing her head off the wall, running around and talking to people who werent there. You could hear her from the bus stop up the road, it was the scariest thing I ever saw and most probably, in the early 70s, would have even then been called delerium or mania, I can imagine in Van Gogh's time there were many things that could trigger high fevers and the symptoms of such.  I have what used to be Aspergers and wondered if he had something along those lines as he seems not to read societal cues awfully well.  What you said about delerium was exactly what I was trying to explain about my sister's reaction to anti cholera or yellow fever vaccine (we both had both of these the same day but an hour apart, with me expecting the same to happen to me at any moment!).",

                    "text": "It is very sad and most annoying to keep the story that Van Gogh did suicide by shooting himself with a pistol in the field where he was supposedly painting. Van Gogh did not shot himself, he was shot maliciously by one of the youth gathered as a small group not far from the place he was staying in. The altercation took place just at the outskirts of what was then the small provincial town of Auvers sur Oise. He was on his way to the field with all his equipment to paint. Van Gogh was constantly mock by the youth he would come across been understood by them as a mad man and a derelict . The youth of shot at him by bravado used the pistol taken secretly from his father who was working as a security gardian in circus. Van Gogh never had a firearm nor did he had any money to buy one. Furthermore, Van Gogh still had some energy left in him to return to his hotel which was a short distance from where the shooting took place. The story that he shoot himself in the field cannot stand since wounded as he was he wouldn't have the strength to come back with all his equipment to the hotel where he was staying. Van Gogh didn't talk to the police about it, he had his reason not doing  so, perhaps he reacted to the youth in such a way that it ended being shot more as an accident that a deliberate act of killings. The tragedy is that the art world stick to the story of suicide since it made the biography of the artist even more dramatic with a grand finale of a suicide. The youth who shot Van Gogh was well know in the village to be eccentric and showing off in the group. The best part of it is that when the man was on his death bed he confessed having shoot Van Gogh, although not intentionally but out of bravado and understood the all situation as an incident. The boy was just a teenager then. So, even that many people understood that Van Gogh did not shot himself and some very few biographies mention this fact, the story stuck officially since it made Van Gogh an even more tragic  figure. There was no need to hide this fact about Van Gogh but like many stories taken for true while they are not, the landing of men on the moon is one out of many, we are continuing to lie to ourselves and to others like politicians do around the world, and like it is said the bigger the lie the more probable it will be accepted and believed by the population at large. If one is to take time to read all the letters of Van Gogh and there are many, not once did he talked about suicide even in the darkest and most tragic moment of his life. Van Gogh was too much of a creative mind to think of death, he certainly didn't look after himself health wise due to his poverty and some ignorance about what drinking and smoking can do on one health, the end of the 19th century was not brilliant about such reality, that's said, Van Gogh used alcohol to numb the pain he was dealing with mentally an physically but this doesn't amount to a conscious drive to destroy himself. Once Hollywood took under his hat to make a film about the artist, things got even more out of reality, but what to expect from Hollywood one may ask.",

I read of Vincent‚Äôs life however, became so obsessed at one point, when I was around 13.. I remember thinking I must have been him, reincarnated! I was an aitheist, now a Christian. I don‚Äôt believe in reincarnation now. But I do still love and appreciate his paintings. And you have given a thorough depiction of Vincent as a truly caring, compassionate man. I hope he found the peace which eluded him in life. Thank you",

If you take the different life outlook of autistics, compared with the apparently neurotypical, is there any truth in the notion that autism is better identified by clinical psychologists?

I have heard some say that psychiatry in general is more greatly concerned with  medical and pharmaceutical fixes, but I would imagine that many psychiatrists now tend a bit more towards a psychological understanding and social amelioration. And do you think this apparent division between psychiatry and psychology is actually very constructive.",

Somehow one's heart goes out to him. There is an interesting link between the Artist and the Free State province of South Africa, where I live. I will just relate it from memory, but the facts can readily be googled. A younger brother of Van Gogh volunteered to fight on the side of the Boers in the Anglo Boer War. Van Gogh had given him a painting of the younger sibling and his sister playing in a barn. Cornelius carried the painting with him wherever he went when going to war. He was wounded near Brandfort (now named Winnie Mandela) which happens to be where I was born. He was nursed by a Boer family but was eventually sent to the British field hospital at Brandfort. The painting was kept in a coffin for some time, a convenient place of storage in common use by the Boers, its presence in an attic, or barn, being a common precaution in case of need in a country of vast distances and travel at the pace of an ox. Cornelius succumbed to his wounds and was buried in the military Cemetry at Brandfort. The painting was said to have been discovered and adorned the wall of a Free State farmhouse for years. It has since disappeared. With the passage of time, many farmhouses have become derelict, the owners being bought out by more prosperous neighbours. I often wonder what the fate of the painting was. No doubt, its value could support the purchase of a multitude of farms.",

He didn't seem to keep \"sketchbooks\" as such and there were no canvas boards back then, no acrylic gesso that you could slap over cardboard and paint oils or acrylics on top. He had to make a full oil painting on canvas or no painting at all. Some of his interior scenes like the picture of his bedroom and the one of a pipe on a chair look amateurish to me, but others like like the crows on the wheat field look like masterpieces. Also he died pretty young. If only he'd lived for longer we could have had even more masterpieces!",

                    "text": "This was very VERY interesting indeed!! I always thought that Van Gogh had Epilepsy. I have Epilepsy myself and have mental illness in my family. Mary Queen of Scots is my 11th great-aunt which makes me related to King George lll who was mentally ill. Not to mention Prince John who died from Epilepsy, which was the exact kind that I have. Anyway, Mental illness and Epilepsy are completely different. The only thing they have in common is that they both take place in the brain. Although I did love his paintings, Epilepsy is why I always found Van Gogh so interesting. The only time anything that is described here happened to me was years ago when I was on medications that came with those side-effects though. New medications had been made to try on me but sadly some did come with HUGELY life changing side-effects. It makes you realize the beauty of life itself. Still, I can honestly say that I can not relate to all of the things he did, etc. Epilepsy alone could not have created those behaviours. Being poisioned now that could create such behaviour. It's noted in this documentary (perfectly and very wisely I might add) that his acting like he did started before eating paints, etc. I've been through ALOT but I can't even IMAGINE! How horrible!  Have researchers studied this because it's kinda obvious to me that he probably didn't have Epilepsy. The ONLY thing that even points to convlusing seizures is when they put him on a bed in the hospital. Did his doctors actually put Epilepsy on his file? I always thought they did! Am I wrong there?! The other thing that kinda points to Temporal Lobe Epilepsy was his fascination with Religion. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy does open up the part of the brain that understands Spirituality. That creates an interest in things like Religion, Spirituality, etc. Did his doctors also note if he had any control when they had to tie him to a bed because that could have been a mental fit, which is completely different than a physical seizure. In most physical seizures you lose consciousness all together. Your body just continues to convulse without your approval.  Most of the things noted from him only come from a mental disorder and Epilepsy is a physical disorder. Epilepsy can cause a mental disorder but not one that creates those issues. It usually can just create Bipolar or a form of anxiety. It does happen in the brain but is not a mental disorder and people need to realize that. I know the difference because I have extreme mental disorders in my family. Obviously in my ancestors but also in my close family. How that sort of thing can travel for years and not just go away, I have no idea. Why it would choose my family out of I don't know how many related to the Royals is beyond me and also REALLY just bothers me to no end! Getting off topic, I apologize. Sadly though, I know exactly how some DO infact judge even today. It is often assumed that those with Epilepsy have some sort of huge mental disorder and aren't able to think correctly. That people need to stay away from them and that they're evil which is absolutely untrue! Not to mention just wrong and beyond hurtful. That's society though. Van Gogh no doubt had Bipolar but the fact is Bipolar doesn't come with all of the things Epilepsy comes with nor the things that happened to him. I'm no doctor but I don't believe that even the worst cases of Bipolar come with cutting your ear off, etc. Personally, I think he had a very very serious mental illness but as I said, I'm not a doctor so I can't claim to know what it was. I do know that this documentary is wonderful!!! Thank you for making it. I have to note one more thing. A theory made years after someones death is great but it's not proof of anything. Again, amazing documentary and thank you for it!",

His mother's apparent critical rejection of him, and her finding fault with    everything he said and it sounds like, hating everything he did, would damage him from his early childhood on, and into adulthood. So I think he would  have learned confusing and negative  ideas about love. Or even about what love really meant.  No wonder  his adult relationships failed.  It seems as if she routinely treated him poorly . In my experience    Dutch Protestant family culture tends to be judgemental, cold and without compassion.",

Some cultures have the tall poppy syndrome more prevalent than others though. Everything seems to be political now. Beeing seen as an individual can only be done through conforming to sociatal norms, since everything is so overstructured and institutionalized. The only creative endeavors that did exist was on the internet, for a while, but this too has been overly regulated. Art schools are a parody of themselves.",

Breaking the myth off the tormented painter, separating the ill from his work. Giving the work the value off its own. Living in Amsterdam, i am well known with the work, all tough the fare better works are exposed in the Kroller-Muller Museum near the town off Apeldoorn.\nThere he really masterd painting. As an Art Historian  i am familar with Van Gogh and indeed in literature it lacks a proper medical approach.  You filed in this gap. As mental ill painter am i lucky to live now and apply medicine.\nFurther mental ill artist i would like to suggest: Wilhelm Lehmbruck.\nBy the way, are you standing in front off the Kershaw edition off Hitler?\n\nBest regards,  Drs.

Born into wealth, brought out as a ‚Äúdebutante ‚Äú in the 30‚Äôs (read her short story ‚ÄúThe Debutante ‚Äú, fascinating!) she later ran away to Paris with surrealist painter Max Ernst, was forced to flee to Spain when the Nazis put him in a concentration camp, was forced into a Spanish mental asylum by her controlling father & received heinous treatment there. She eventually escaped to Mexico where she remained for the rest of her life, churning out a huge body of surrealist works; mainly paintings but also books, sculpture, plays and more. In the comment below I‚Äôll link a really awesome documentary made by her great-niece, it‚Äôs here on YouTube. I love your channel & just subbed. Keep up the great work! ‚ù§",

It does make one wonder if we would even know of him at all if his early trajectory had resulted instead in a happy marriage, or a more successful role in the church? He clearly was searching for the intimacy borne of physical union, a sense of connectedness, in addition to a deeper metaphysical transcendence, and the anguish of those early denials/ rejections must have weighed very heavily on both his heart and head.  Add to this the terribly chaotic nature of much of his adult life, and the sense of failure he felt. It must have been torment for someone with such an incredible artistic vision, the constant fear of poverty, loneliness and madness. This piece on Vincent was beautifully and sensitively done. It's the least he deserved.",

I never felt so close to VVG as I did, seeing so many personal effects. Even the white cap worn by Dr. Gachet in that very famous VG painting of him, seated at a table with sprigs of foxglove in his hand. \n\nYour documentary was wonderful. His life is like an onion with many hidden layers, twists and turns, and still coming to light.\n\nYour documentary was wonderful. But I must ask you about something about Theo toward the end of the video. You mentioned Theo had neurosyphilis. Did I hear that correctly? I was positive Theo was a solid, dedicated and loyal husband.",

Van Gogh was right-handed, and the wound was on the left side of the abdomen.  No powder burns were seen on his hands or his body, indicating that the gun was not close when it was fired. A prime suspect is Ren√© Secr√©tan.  He was a bully and liked to dress up like a cowboy and play with a pistol that frequently misfired. Vincent was already a social outcast. Rene and his friends were known to play pranks on Van Gogh. An eye-witness woman said that Van Gogh was not painting in the wheatfield that day, but walking on the road. When the people of the town were interviewed in later years, they said that young boys did it.  Van Gogh was too kind to rat them out.",

My eye doctor tried to talk to me about Monet, only artist he knew of.. because art historians just go over and over the same old names to the absurd.\nWhat I am asking of you is to pull an unknown artist from history and educate the public further than, as I call, the tried, true and the banal. \nI recently saw an exhibit of Scandinavian women painters who lived in Paris in the 19c.

                    "text": "\"Vincent Van Gogh, one of the Dutch painters, could not sell a single painting in his whole life. Now only two hundred paintings have survived out of thousands that he painted, because nobody took care of them. He was simply distributing them to friends; nobody would purchase them. People were afraid even to hang his paintings in their sitting rooms because whoever would see them would think that they were crazy: what kind of painting are you hanging here? People were taking them ‚Äî not to hurt him ‚Äî thanking him, and throwing his paintings into their basements so nobody would see. Now each of his paintings is worth a million dollars. What happened in one hundred years? The man himself was forced into a mad asylum when he was only thirty-two. And he was forced because of his painting ‚Äî he was not harmful, he was not violent, he was not doing anything to anybody. But anybody who looked at his paintings was absolutely certain that this man was mad and unreliable. He should be put in a madhouse. If he could paint these things, he might do anything‚Ä¶.‚Äù For example, he always painted stars as spirals. Even other painters told him, ‚ÄúStars are not spirals!‚Äù\r\n\r\nHe said, ‚ÄúI also see the stars. I see that they are not spirals, but the moment I start painting them something in me says so strongly that they are spirals. The distance is so vast‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why your eyes cannot see exactly what their shape is. And the voice is so strong. I am simply unable to do anything else but what my inner being says to do.‚Äù\r\n\r\nAnd now physicists have discovered that stars are spirals. It has gone like a shock throughout the world of painters, that only one painter in the whole history of man had some inner contact and communication with the stars ‚Äî and that was a man who was thought to be mad. And because he was thought to be mad, nobody was ready to give him any service. Every week, his brother used to give him enough money to last for seven days. And he was fasting three days in a week and eating four days ‚Äî because that was the only way to purchase canvas and colors and brushes to paint. Painting was more important than life. He committed suicide at the age of thirty -three. Just after his release from the madhouse, he painted only one painting, which they had prevented him from painting in the madhouse. He wanted to paint the sun. It took him one year. He lost his eyes‚Ä¶ the burning sun, the hot sun, and the whole day long he would be watching all the colors, from the morning till the evening, from the sunrise to the sunset. He wanted the painting to contain everything about the sun, the whole biography of the sun. Everybody who was sympathetic to him told him, ‚ÄúThis is too much. Just studying it one day is enough; it is the same sun.‚Äù\r\n\r\nVan Gogh said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know. It is never the same. You have never looked at it. I have never seen the same sunrise twice, never seen the same sunset again. And I want my painting to be a biography.‚Äù One year‚Ä¶ the whole day watching the sun‚Ä¶ He lost his eyes, but he painted. And when the painting was complete, he wrote a small letter to his brother: ‚ÄúI am not committing suicide out of any despair ‚Äî because I am one of the most successful men in the world. I have done whatever I wanted to do in spite of the whole world condemning me. But this was my last wish, to paint the whole biography of the sun in one painting. It is completed today. I am immensely joyful, and now there is no need to live. I was living to paint; painting was my life, not breathing.‚Äù And he shot himself dead. You cannot categorize him with ordinary suicides. It is not a suicide ‚Äî out of despair, out of sadness, out of failure ‚Äî no. Out of immense success, out of total fulfillment, seeing that now, why unnecessarily go on living and waiting for death?‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have done the work that I wanted to do.‚Äù Every creative artist has to understand this: the moment people start thinking about him that he is a little bit off center, that something is loose in his head, he should rejoice that he has crossed the boundary of the mundane and the mediocre. Now he has grown the wings which others don‚Äôt have.\"",

He exhibited almost textbook neuro-divergent behavior.\n\nMental illness is such a scourge!  It robs a person of the ability to truly be themselves.  It‚Äôs a big issue on both sides of my family and I have seen and personally experienced it‚Äôs devastating effects.    I can‚Äôt imagine what it would‚Äôve been like to be so mentally ill and have no real medication or other treatments available to deal with the illness.  Even in these supposedly enlightened times too many people still believe that mental illness is a personal failure to deal with life and not the physical disease that it truly is.\n\nVan Gogh has my love and admiration for bringing such truth and beauty to our world in spite of the physical and mental illness issues that plagued his sadly too short life.  Isn‚Äôt it ironic that the man who struggled to sell his paintings during his life is now internationally respected and loved the world over.  I have to hope that wherever and whatever sphere he now inhabits that he‚Äôs able to see how much beauty and joy his paintings have brought numberless people in the 133 years since his tragic death in 1890.",

This makes me wonder if he hears differently from us.\nVincent, taking his own life, suggests to me that the pain he felt mentally was more than he could withstand, a breaking point as such. Only those who have had this kind of pain can truly understand it, and the need to shut it down.\nVincent had his brother, who sustained him through that pain for many years.

Added to this he was the first born. It‚Äôs good to look into birth order. Often first borns are criticised more compared to, let‚Äôs say, the last born. Furthermore, based on our knowledge today of the brain-gut connection, Van Gogh‚Äôs poor diet must have impacted his mental health. Then we need to consider what, Ross Rosenberg (who has a YouTube channel), calls the self-love deficit disorder, a result of attachment issues in childhood. Ross also discusses the human magnet syndrome, which may also need to be considered in relation to the people Van Gogh attracted at work, while studying and in his personal life. He certainly displays a lot of self sabotaging behaviours in all areas of his life. Of course, there could be genetics, as well as generational behaviours passed down the family tree. I believe also, Van Gogh appeared to be the family scapegoat in his family, especially after hearing how his parents treated him. From my point of view, too many individuals who present with similar mental health issues as Van Gogh are labelled with Autism or Asperger‚Äôs, when in fact, they are likely the product of poor childhood attachment and/or growing up in a toxic family, with parents, who themselves are likely the product of poor attachment or family toxicity. All of which, can be a generational curse. It was nice to hear that Van Gogh had at least, and what appeared to be, a kind brother. I enjoyed this video. A thumbs up üëç",

In drawing a Venn diagram, one will find a similarity of traits between Autism and Trauma. Diagnosis‚Äôs (associated with human behaviour) need to be considered carefully and seriously, as labels can be hard to remove once given, especially if the label has led to injustices and prejudices. I suppose this is one of the challenges for those in professions associated with human behaviour and linguistics where a disability may be ‚Äòhidden‚Äô (requiring time to gather evidence) compared to a profession (e.g., an oncologist) where the evidence can be quicker to gather (e.g., on an x-ray). Though, I‚Äôm aware, there are exceptions to the rule in this statement. As always, I like the analysis of your videos : )",

She could not afford her rent and had become homeless.\nVincent Van Gogh took pity on her and gave the women his house. He decided to go and live in one of the coal mining shacks instead. There was no furniture in the shacks and he was forced to sleep on the bare wooden floor with a blanket. The locals called him: \"The Christ of the coal mines\".\nEven though the common people loved him, the church committee was humiliated. They did not want someone who was living in squalor to represent their religion, so they fired him.\"",

                    "text": "\"Vincent Van Gogh, one of the Dutch painters, could not sell a single painting in his whole life. Now only two hundred paintings have survived out of thousands that he painted, because nobody took care of them. He was simply distributing them to friends; nobody would purchase them. People were afraid even to hang his paintings in their sitting rooms because whoever would see them would think that they were crazy: what kind of painting are you hanging here? People were taking them ‚Äî not to hurt him ‚Äî thanking him, and throwing his paintings into their basements so nobody would see. Now each of his paintings is worth a million dollars. What happened in one hundred years? The man himself was forced into a mad asylum when he was only thirty-two. And he was forced because of his painting ‚Äî he was not harmful, he was not violent, he was not doing anything to anybody. But anybody who looked at his paintings was absolutely certain that this man was mad and unreliable. He should be put in a madhouse. If he could paint these things, he might do anything‚Ä¶.‚Äù For example, he always painted stars as spirals. Even other painters told him, ‚ÄúStars are not spirals!‚Äù\r\n\r\nHe said, ‚ÄúI also see the stars. I see that they are not spirals, but the moment I start painting them something in me says so strongly that they are spirals. The distance is so vast‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why your eyes cannot see exactly what their shape is. And the voice is so strong. I am simply unable to do anything else but what my inner being says to do.‚Äù\r\n\r\nAnd now physicists have discovered that stars are spirals. It has gone like a shock throughout the world of painters, that only one painter in the whole history of man had some inner contact and communication with the stars ‚Äî and that was a man who was thought to be mad. And because he was thought to be mad, nobody was ready to give him any service. Every week, his brother used to give him enough money to last for seven days. And he was fasting three days in a week and eating four days ‚Äî because that was the only way to purchase canvas and colors and brushes to paint. Painting was more important than life. He committed suicide at the age of thirty -three. Just after his release from the madhouse, he painted only one painting, which they had prevented him from painting in the madhouse. He wanted to paint the sun. It took him one year. He lost his eyes‚Ä¶ the burning sun, the hot sun, and the whole day long he would be watching all the colors, from the morning till the evening, from the sunrise to the sunset. He wanted the painting to contain everything about the sun, the whole biography of the sun. Everybody who was sympathetic to him told him, ‚ÄúThis is too much. Just studying it one day is enough; it is the same sun.‚Äù\r\n\r\nVan Gogh said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know. It is never the same. You have never looked at it. I have never seen the same sunrise twice, never seen the same sunset again. And I want my painting to be a biography.‚Äù One year‚Ä¶ the whole day watching the sun‚Ä¶ He lost his eyes, but he painted. And when the painting was complete, he wrote a small letter to his brother: ‚ÄúI am not committing suicide out of any despair ‚Äî because I am one of the most successful men in the world. I have done whatever I wanted to do in spite of the whole world condemning me. But this was my last wish, to paint the whole biography of the sun in one painting. It is completed today. I am immensely joyful, and now there is no need to live. I was living to paint; painting was my life, not breathing.‚Äù And he shot himself dead. You cannot categorize him with ordinary suicides. It is not a suicide ‚Äî out of despair, out of sadness, out of failure ‚Äî no. Out of immense success, out of total fulfillment, seeing that now, why unnecessarily go on living and waiting for death?‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have done the work that I wanted to do.‚Äù Every creative artist has to understand this: the moment people start thinking about him that he is a little bit off center, that something is loose in his head, he should rejoice that he has crossed the boundary of the mundane and the mediocre. Now he has grown the wings which others don‚Äôt have.\"",

Moreover, he is a true advocate of life philosophy. \nEspecially in today's society, we are constantly seeking ‚Äúworry‚Äù ideas of life. \nI was a workaholic and influenced by the worry ideology of my mother and society, tend to NOT believe in personal spiritual growth and seeking true passion while finally became a ‚Äúwhite sheep ‚Äú of society and pop culture whom expect me to become.\nHowever, I am lucky because I met my husband Boe who is share same ideology as Vincent. Ever since we are together I finally understand that the true meaning of life is to become a person you really want to become from your heart. \nHe and Vincent‚Äôs ideologies are like a message from heaven. We as humans are lucky to have creativity, passion and wisdom. And we must follow our own heart and protect our true love. Because Vincent had been alone and misunderstood of his entire life. As individual, I learnt that we must protect people like my husband and Vincent who is truly seeking for passion and meaning in life.",

When they returned to town he never was seen with the pistol again. Vincent was being nice because the kids were known for playing pranks on him and it was most likely an accident.",

That means that they painted portraits of people that they knew, and often located them in daily settings, such as their garden, or at the table. They also painted people in street scenes, at entertainments, and so on.  \n\nat 9:40    \"Most of the Impressionists only painted on days when the weather was beautiful.  This is a serious misinterpretation of what the Impressionists were about.  \"Impressionism\" refers to capturing fleeting impressions. - i.e. they typically painted in all weathers, and without regard to finding \"the perfect light\". The light that they painted was whatever light was available-  dawn, morning, noonday sun, hot afternoon, snow storms, rain, drizzle, fog, dusk on the river, night in the street, and the coal dust and smoke of a railway station.    THIS is primarily what Impressionism was about. \n\nat 9:50  The picture of the Impressionists as knowing the market, only selling a painting once in a while and finding time to party does not ring true. \nSome of the Impressionists, Monet in particular, were enormously productive.  \nOccasionally some, Renoir in particular, would get a commission that brought in a good deal of money. These were generally family portraits.  But  mostly their works were small landscapes that were not going to make them rich.  Monet did not get BIG commissions until late in his life, after Vincent's death. Henri Toulouse-Lautrec painted most of his pictures on cardboard, and designed posters.",

I did learn a little more with the help of a song by Don McLean simply titled \"Vincent\", a hauntingly beautiful song that touches on his struggles and moved me deeply.....thank you so much for filling in where my formal education failed! It was nice to know that he had a nephew whom probably brought him joy.",

If you read a lot about him, it is written that he knew he was a good painter. I hope that I can watch the video with the red headed man with Starry Night behind him. He talked to a man from hell. The voice was scary. He asked to be taken out. I don't believe in hell, but this would be great for Halloween. I get off the topic because I suffer from bipolar disorder. There is a theory that Vincent Van Gogh didn't kill himself because it debunked that he could get the bullet where it came into him. Another theory was that he was shot by a teenager. My theory is that I believe that he didn't want the teenager to get the death penalty. He didn't say that he shot himself. He said that this is the way it was meant to be as I remember. I believe that he wanted to be an author. There's an autobiography by Vincent Van Gogh. It has to do with himself writing to his brother, Theo. But it is a possibility that Theo killed himself over grief. The painter was highly against suicide. I guess that he rather die than be rescued and be a medical patient and have his murderer not executed. That I guess he suffered from borderline personality. I never heard of people with his diagnosis doing what he did.  I like Edvard Munch. I can't identify with anyone. I am an individual like everyone else.",

I make music, write; stories, poetry and just miscellaneous subjects I find interesting, I paint; watercolor, oil and acrylic, I've sold one painting so far. A huge oil painting i did for my neighbor for $200 it brought me joy not just because I made money off my art but mostly because it brought someone else so much joy. My niche is watercolor and calligraphy. I feel I truly resonate with van gogh, his struggles with mental illness and pain but also his HUGE heart. I am so loving and kind but that often gets me taken advantage of. The town I live in is small-minded and full of negativity but thats why my light is needed most here. People laugh at me and think I'm crazy because I am free and live to the toot of my own horn. But maybe I am a humble genius too. Never wanting to be cocky about it but also being so brilliant other people hate me for it and misunderstand me for a fool. I don't care though, I know I'm here to do good things and that's all that matters. I am brilliant and I believe in what I do (most of the time.) So I'm not going to stop for nothing. Just that one neighbour telling me to \"paint with presence\" and saying I have a true gift and to never stop, really changed me. So take it from me, just because everyone thinks you're crazy doesn't mean what you're doing isn't needed in the world. You are so needed, your work is valuable. Even if no one sees it now, who knows in 200 years they might catch up. ü§óü§™üòÖ \nDon't ever give up!!!!! \nOkok this is so inspiring, tysm have a great day!!!!",

He was an intelligent and sensitive man who understood the situation. It is likely that his decision to commit suicide was partly to ensure that he would no longer become a burden to Theo who was having his own anxieties and pain from the complexities of both personal and professional reasons during the time of Vincent‚Äôs death.",

But people will eat up anything that is told to them and so long as we keep screaming and teaching that he was a genius, everyone will keep believing it.\n\nI can agree he was passionate when it came to art. But he sounds like such a creep when it comes to women. I've met men like him, the ones that really just don't get a clue and are really creepy and in your face about it. But no one ever talks about that instead we just keep sprouting the same nonsense we always do. That he is amazing, epic, awesome, the greatest most godlike human artist in the whole universe. No wonder our world is so doomed, no one even thinks for themselves anymore.",

Another inquiry, if I may, isn't the church supposed to represent those living in squalor? Granted, one could not get this message from Jesus because he'll tell you to take care of the meek and the downtrodden and everything else but then at the same time say that he's going to make a family's enemies be the members of their own house because he did not come to bring peace but the sword, otherwise they are not worthy enough to follow him, so at what point does it become hypocrisy that is reconcilable?",

An artist could take his paint kit on location and paint en plien aire. Art supplies are expensive now, they must have been expensive then. I'm an artist. I have a small tube of red oil paint that costs more than twenty loaves of Martin's Potato Bread, the good stuff. I lived on Martin's Potato Bread, toasted with butter and marmalade. Vinny isn't the only starving artist in history. At least his brother helped him. I've been on my own forever. If an artist is supposed to suffer I win that contest with a brother that is nothing but grief. I don't know where the idea that Vinny (he lets me call him Vinny) ate his paint comes from, but I swear it's bs. He might have been crazy, but he wasn't stupid.\n     Too bad about his mother. I read she patched a hole in her chicken coop with one of his paintings. She burned a crate of his paintings! What a loss. Up there with the woman who burned a stash of the Dead Sea Scrolls. \n     Cool video. Vinny is The Legend. Go Van Gogh!",

His short life inspires the deepest of my beliefs on how a true artist operates. His continued struggles with his sanity also speak to his work ethic and determination regarding his artwork, as despite all that was on his plate, he never abandoned his philosophy on life and his creative visions.\n I was a classically trained trombonist of 7 years when I was 16, and I had a huge passion for music. Three quarters through high school, my mental health issues came to the surface pretty rapidly. I quit band, started isolating and seeing a counselor. I began using drugs and alcohol to cope with my own mental health struggles because I was impatient with waiting for the benefits of counseling, and although it was a short two and a half years, my negative relationship with them had gotten to a breaking point. I had stopped attending lectures, started isolating alone in my dorm and was very undernourished. I got sober at 18, and I'm now just shy of two years of continued sobriety. I reignited my passion for music in rehab, and began playing my favorite melodies by ear on the piano. I've now found a different calling in the musical sphere: composing. \nVan Gogh's philosophy on human empathy and the true nature of artistry are some of the main influences that drive me to create, while also inspiring me to do so. I care more about creating things that I recognize as beautiful than conforming to the standards of the public at large, and it's infinitely rewarding. \nGreat video as always. I love your channel, and learning about past figures in different areas of expertise will never bore me. \n\nThanks, Decker",

Many speculate he said he did it as not to get the youbg boy who shot him in trouble. And also, he was shot in the stomach, not the chest. The angle of the gunshot could not have been self-inflicted.\nOtherwise, wonderful video!",

Many artists struggle with mental illness, rejection, drug/alcohol abuse.and financial instability, and it's often a vicious circle. It's for the best though if  they put their trust in God and trust the light in them to share, if they have the courage... If only he had continued on. What a great man, he should be recognized as a saint of the modern era. His art speaks of his yearning for the sublime. When we look at his paintings we are looking at the world through the eyes of a saint.",

It is really largely to Theo's efforts, in addition to the later popularity of Vincent's work, as mentioned here, that Post Impressionism went on to be so helpful to the artists of the 20th century.",

Other research, sadly not presented here, makes a profoundly good case for Gaugin being the one who started and fueled arguments, insisting that Vincent paint like he painted (ie, NOT to to outside to paint,l as Vin entry preferred to do, but to paint from memory like Gaugin did), and Gaugin who cut off Vincent's ear in a rage , and for a local kid/bully for being the one who shot Vincent.\n\n Vincent was just a decent guy who wanted to be an artist and a good friend, but who did not understand how to filter those around him: I think he must have made a point to learn to screen those he allowed I to his life, to set  psychological \"boundaries\" in his next lifetime.",

Thank you Simon for this video, this is my favorite episode of all the video on this channel, not because i was named after him but because of how wonderful and colorful like his paintings the life of Master Vincent Van Gogh besides of the sufferings he experienced during his lifetime. His life teaches us the value of respect and understunding to the people suffering from mental issues like depression, and his life also teaches us the value of love towards our family members like how his brother Theo shows to him, and the value of dedication on the things we love to do in life. His life is truely and really a inspirational. \n\n\n\n\n\nP.S: this is the first ever video in this channel that i almost burst into tears (but few tears came out in my eyes) and the first video i watched twice.",

But I remember Vincent and his life and his work and he gives me hope. He struggled so much and he lived a hard life, but still managed to create beautiful works of art and see the world brightly. I am amazing at How Vincent lived and he inspires me to keep pushing through. I just wish I could tell him how many times he has saved me. I will always remember you Vincent and I will always love you.",

The Netherlands is about twice the size of New Jersey, yet it is borders on French-speaking Belgium and German-speaking Germany. It also has \"a maritime border\" with England. Throughout history and throughout the world, people living near a border tend to speak the languages on both sides of the border. \n\nSo, it's admirable that van Gogh spoke all those languages - but not remarkable, given the time and place. \n\nWe in the US have the privilege (and the curse?) of living our lives without learning a second language. As a result, we often treat learning a second language as a difficult and rare skill. But when you're surrounded by multiple languages, learning them is not an extraordinary ability.",

                    "text": "I am reminded of the Doctor Who episode titled \"Vincent and the Doctor\". It is a poignant look at Vincent's life and struggles near the end of his life. The Doctor (Matt Smith) and Amy Pond visit Vincent to help him battle an invisible creature--but not invisible to Vincent due, probably, to his encroaching madness--called a \"Krafayis.\" The monster-of-the-week is a bit silly, but the overall episode is one of the Whovian community's most beloved.\n\nI won't spoil the episode for anyone who has not seen it, but see it you must. It is an uncharacteristically honest, caring portrayal of Van Gogh in all of his passion and suffering. And if you are not crying by the end of the episode, then YOU don't have a heart. It truly is moving. Even non-Doctor Who fans should find some true compassion and joy for Vincent Van Gogh, his suffering, his unrivaled genius, his small moments of hope, and, in this remarkable episode, a chance at redemption that is offered to Vincent...which, obviously, ultimately, he could not accept due to his unstoppable descent into depression.\n\nThis episode gets me every time. Give it a look. I don''t think that you will be disappointed. And you may even find yourself feeling even more compassion for such a true, unknown-in-his-own-time, unequalled genius who showed us the beauty and the passion that could reside even in a soul wracked by self-doubt, cruel, undeserved madness, and devastating bouts of depression. \"Vincent and the Doctor\" is a gem.",

However, Vincent Van Gogh was shot by two young irresponsible boys who were playing with a loaded gun that shot him as well as he was  bullied him. If, you can do research on whether or not he was in love with a mother or daughter in his first boarding house. Surely, you can do the research on the most update research of his death. Please dont be lazy and really dig deep into great men's lives. Don't short ball them because you are to lazy to do the research. Reading is fundemental. Please do more research on Vincent Van Gogh.",

It's a really effective portrayal of his later life, and Willem Dafoe does a superb job in the role.",

He was quite rude sometimes, but always true to the heart. The murder was a big shock in the Netherlands and some people see it as one of the first terrorist attacks of Islam in Europe.",

I am sure this self harming behavior continued throughout his life\n\nTherefore, when he realized how much he screwed up his friendship by chasing Gauguin with a razor blade, he clearly felt he needed to punish himself for his mistake. So out of anger at himself, he cut off his ear.",

If jesus were alive today (I'm an atheist but this is a thought experiment) then I've no doubt church leaders would shun him\nEdit-absinthe DOES NOT CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS!!! It's likely that it was just because absinthe is extremely strong and people dra k a lot of it that caused hallucinations but other drinks like vodka and whiskey could do the same. Similarly if someone is physically addicted to alcohol they sometimes hallucinate when in withdrawals so if that person is known for drinking absinthe and then they trip out from withdrawals people would put 2+2 together and get 5. Seems like van Gogh was physically addicted to alcohol since he was having seizures while in hospital for his ear as well as being delirious (presumably he couldn't get alcohol in hospital). Just had to clear that up lol",

The latter being such a good hearted person, apparently did one last act of kindness even in his death. Reports of him being bullied by a young french boy who was obsessed with western movies and cowboy lifestyle who also carried a gun in a holster at all time, as part of his cowboy outfit. The little boy‚Äôs sibling, another boy who was fascinated by the art world and Vincent‚Äôs work, caused Vincent to built an amicable relationship with the latter. \n\nThe ‚Äúcowboy wannabe‚Äù sibling was a little bit of a bully to Vincent, nonetheless Vincent still liked to hang out with the pair. Vincent also having a tendency to shoot back funny jokes and comebacks at the cowboy kid, back and forth and the other little boy (the art enthusiast) would learn and watch Vincent paint and will ask about life In Paris as he was in love with the art of painting. So Vincent had a prot√©ger with a brother that had no interest in the arts and was obsessed with westerns. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he wasn‚Äôt a terrible kid but he couldn‚Äôt care any less about painting. Some researchers announced that after investigations about the death of Vincent it‚Äôs said that in that same field that Vincent was painting and supposedly shot himself, he wasn‚Äôt alone that day. He was believed to have been with the brothers. When he returned to his residence he supposedly walked back but at the time, the blood splat pattern, him having a strong stance against committing suicide, disappearance of his painting equipments, or even the gun has never been found. Just doesn‚Äôt add up to Vincent‚Äôs version of events. (Vincent‚Äôs account of the whole thing was that he shot himself, thrown the gun, he passed out for a while and when he woke up he couldn‚Äôt find the gun to finish off the job that‚Äôs when he walked back to his residence and died at home) \n\nwhat doesn‚Äôt add up is that, Vincent was seen leaving his house with painting equipments that were never found. Even more interesting is that evidence gathered by investigators point that he was covering up what really happened that day until his last breath. \n\n1. If he shot himself the wound would‚Äôve been in a self inflicted area, most likely a head-wound and that would‚Äôve been the most effective way. The wound was on his stomach.\n\n2. Vincent lied about the throwing away of the gun after the alleged self inflicted stomach shot. Cause sure that whole part  make sense. \n\n3. His clothes looked like the wound was fresh as they weren‚Äôt drenched in blood, what would happen if someone shoots himself in the stomach and lose consciousness for sometime in the ground. His clothes weren‚Äôt. \n\n4. he insisted repeatedly and was adamant with the suicide theory that it was forcibly accepted as the real fate of this martyred genius. \n\n5. The two boys and their father left abruptly for another city the day or the day after Van Gogh‚Äôs death. And the young cowboy dude didn‚Äôt have his gun and never carried it in his holster ever again. \n\nMany more little little elements that don‚Äôt seem to fit Vincent‚Äôs events. \n\nAfter reading about all that it made me realise that he didn‚Äôt see any reason in saying that he was shot by children as it may have been an accident, the young boy messing with his gun, shot him by accident. He decided to not ruin the little boys‚Äô lives. Another side of the big hearted, tortured genius, that was in my opinion ahead of his time and while in bed dying he  said ‚Äúdo not accuse anyone.. it is I who wanted to kill myself‚Äù \n\nAgain plenty to take from the new informations on the accounts of his death.",

It crossed my mind a few times before getting help after those caring for me experienced their own money troubles. I'd skip meals or ration out a meal to last me 2 days, just enough to keep the starvation pain to a minimum. I digress, his giving his church housing away strikes me as exactly the level of compassion and charity that should be something for the others in the church to aspire to, not shunning him.",

Vincent was shot in the lower stomach from about a couple of meters distance. Why would anyone shoot himself in the guts if the objective is to kill oneself? And how could a man shoot himself while operating a gun from several meters away? And Vincent could not have just 'found a gun'. This was rural France in the 19th century. Basically no one owned a gun or had even seen a revolver in their lifetime. There is a far more convincing theory about what happened. Vincent was accidentally shot by the only boy in town who in fact did own a gun. A boy and his friends who had been bullying Vincent ever since he came to live in Auvers.",

The book came out on Van Gogh which describes his death differently. The author found out Vincent did not shoot himself, but it was some local boys around town that were messing with Van Gogh in the wheat fields. The gun went off accidently shooting the beloved Artist. I recommend  checking this and doing a fact check just in case. Stay well Simon.",

He actually was shot in his stomach - not in his chest - and given his deep religious feeling, I've long doubted the whole suicide theory.  Not to mention, shooting oneself in the stomach is hardly the most efficient way to commit suicide.  But, that's just my opinion.  Also, given his affinity for the poor and the lower classes; I think he'd be shocked and not particularly pleased by what his paintings sell for now.  But, again; this is just my opinion.",

A study found many people with diagnosable personality disorders are very artistic.  Artists really are often tortured by their painful inner selves, and yet have tremendous gifts.  I have learned that setting boundaries that people who care about you are willing to understand and honor helps so much.  Artists often need periods of downtime to recharge and be alone to shake off the debris of other people.  Its equally important for them to get out and occasionally be with others so they don't experience too many intrusive thoughts or worries. Some laughter and camaraderie blows away the mental cobwebs. \nEvery person who finds people draining knows exactly what I mean.  It's a balancing act that is hard to get just right, but it's essential to try, so depression and loneliness don't get to be the dominant emotion....",

Even if there would have been someone with a gun: who in their right mind would give that gun to the local foreigner madman who had just cut off his own ear? Also he was not shot 'nearly missing his heart' like this man said but he was shot in his stomach from several meters distance. Why would anyone shoot himself in the guts if the intention would be to kill oneself? Check out uoutubbe or google. There is a far better theory about what actually happened that day. He was accidentally shot by a boy who bullied him a lot and actually did own a revolver.",

I've heard this before, actually years ago there was some talk that Vincent was shot by a youth and he forgave and protected him.  Vincent WAS carrying a gun though, and extremely unhappy, I think the whole situation may have been a strange intersection of terrible moments that led to his death.  In the end, it doesn't matter, unless for religious beliefs about suicide.  He died, and it was very tragic.

Another account says he was shot in town by a young boy who thought the gun was not loaded pulling the trigger as a joke and when Vincent was shot, took the gun away, told the boy to run back home, he took the gun back home.  The entire basis of his suicide is based on the answer to the question \"who shot you\" with Vincent's reply \"no one\".  Years later that same boy now a middle aged man recounted the events and stated he was in fact the one who shot Vincent Van Gogh.  But few believed him even though new evidence in recent years suggests the story told by the man who claimed to have shot him to be far more likely the the \"more famous\" recounting of events most people have come to believe despite no evidence that Vincent ever even left the town that day before his gunshot wound.",

I believe what they present . I also heard that it is discussed in the movie Loving Vincent , but I only got to see a little bit of that movie not the whole thing ... so if you haven't seen that it will be a real treat as you can check out some film clips and see how beautifully rendered it was .\n   The reason I asked you if you were interested is because originally I was posting this information here in the comment section and three people got really really irritated and told me to stop .",

More likely the mental asylum offers food and painting equipment so that he doesnt have to worry about money. We are looking at the 19th century, how advance is the medical science on mental health? Was it mental or a developmental disorder like Asperger? Nobody at that time really knows. Without a proper diagnosis and treatment he himself may be driven into depression due to his unknown condition and eventually lead to being suicidal.",

                    "text": "\"Vincent Van Gogh, one of the Dutch painters, could not sell a single painting in his whole life. Now only two hundred paintings have survived out of thousands that he painted, because nobody took care of them. He was simply distributing them to friends; nobody would purchase them. People were afraid even to hang his paintings in their sitting rooms because whoever would see them would think that they were crazy: what kind of painting are you hanging here? People were taking them ‚Äî not to hurt him ‚Äî thanking him, and throwing his paintings into their basements so nobody would see. Now each of his paintings is worth a million dollars. What happened in one hundred years? The man himself was forced into a mad asylum when he was only thirty-two. And he was forced because of his painting ‚Äî he was not harmful, he was not violent, he was not doing anything to anybody. But anybody who looked at his paintings was absolutely certain that this man was mad and unreliable. He should be put in a madhouse. If he could paint these things, he might do anything‚Ä¶.‚Äù For example, he always painted stars as spirals. Even other painters told him, ‚ÄúStars are not spirals!‚Äù\r\n\r\nHe said, ‚ÄúI also see the stars. I see that they are not spirals, but the moment I start painting them something in me says so strongly that they are spirals. The distance is so vast‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why your eyes cannot see exactly what their shape is. And the voice is so strong. I am simply unable to do anything else but what my inner being says to do.‚Äù\r\n\r\nAnd now physicists have discovered that stars are spirals. It has gone like a shock throughout the world of painters, that only one painter in the whole history of man had some inner contact and communication with the stars ‚Äî and that was a man who was thought to be mad. And because he was thought to be mad, nobody was ready to give him any service. Every week, his brother used to give him enough money to last for seven days. And he was fasting three days in a week and eating four days ‚Äî because that was the only way to purchase canvas and colors and brushes to paint. Painting was more important than life. He committed suicide at the age of thirty -three. Just after his release from the madhouse, he painted only one painting, which they had prevented him from painting in the madhouse. He wanted to paint the sun. It took him one year. He lost his eyes‚Ä¶ the burning sun, the hot sun, and the whole day long he would be watching all the colors, from the morning till the evening, from the sunrise to the sunset. He wanted the painting to contain everything about the sun, the whole biography of the sun. Everybody who was sympathetic to him told him, ‚ÄúThis is too much. Just studying it one day is enough; it is the same sun.‚Äù\r\n\r\nVan Gogh said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know. It is never the same. You have never looked at it. I have never seen the same sunrise twice, never seen the same sunset again. And I want my painting to be a biography.‚Äù One year‚Ä¶ the whole day watching the sun‚Ä¶ He lost his eyes, but he painted. And when the painting was complete, he wrote a small letter to his brother: ‚ÄúI am not committing suicide out of any despair ‚Äî because I am one of the most successful men in the world. I have done whatever I wanted to do in spite of the whole world condemning me. But this was my last wish, to paint the whole biography of the sun in one painting. It is completed today. I am immensely joyful, and now there is no need to live. I was living to paint; painting was my life, not breathing.‚Äù And he shot himself dead. You cannot categorize him with ordinary suicides. It is not a suicide ‚Äî out of despair, out of sadness, out of failure ‚Äî no. Out of immense success, out of total fulfillment, seeing that now, why unnecessarily go on living and waiting for death?‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have done the work that I wanted to do.‚Äù Every creative artist has to understand this: the moment people start thinking about him that he is a little bit off center, that something is loose in his head, he should rejoice that he has crossed the boundary of the mundane and the mediocre. Now he has grown the wings which others don‚Äôt have.\"",

After this incident letters show that Theo hasn't been sure what to do with his brother. He didn't really want to take care of him and hoped that Vincent will make the suggestion to go to a mental illness hospital. Theo seemed quite happy for his brother's decision because it meant less work for him who wanted to focus on his wedding. So much for the always supportive brother i guess. Vincent also fell in love with Dr Gachet's daughter who (according to a letter she sent her friend) loved him back. Unfortunately Dr Gachet didn't like this and forbid contacting each other. It is suggested that this situation was another factor that led to his suicide in the end (which Matthias Arnold thinks was his fourth attempt)",

It wouldn't take long for you to learn to say his name correctly. I don't mean that you should have a perfect pronunciation but at least say the correct name. I think it would be written something like \"Goff\" in English to sound similar, but I am not sure. I'm not an English native speaker neither Dutch but I know for sure that it isn't supposed to be like Van Goe or Go.",

The gun was also not located in the feild where his painting supplies had been left. There was a boy in town who was obsessed with cowboys and he bullied van Gogh. The very day van Gogh was shot, the boy and his family fled in the night back to their home in the city. They were visiting for the summer and left weeks before they told people they had been planning to go home. Van Gogh insisted to others he was the one who did it, no one else, so no one but him could be blamed. Despite being bullied that summer by the boy, he wanted to protect him as he laid dying. Van Gogh had always been adamantly opposed to suicide due to his Christian beliefs and upbringing (he even tried to become a pastor at one point).",

My brother certainly did have bright moods as a little kiddo and teen. I would like to have known a bit of Van Gogh's, up moods. I can very much imagine his struggles ... since Iam older sister to a sibling who has to be attentive and mindful to when the 'grey' shrouds him- and is able to manage himself. Yet art often is result of being in & with a mood, an amazing outlet of expression of whats going on inside one's self ~ (& hard work, focus & talent)",

And yet he was such a genius who left a great legacy for mankind that makes me think that inside each of us is something special and unique. Vincent van Gogh‚Äôs is an example of this. Thank you for a   beautiful video. It made my day.",

So much (many brush strokes) with so little (focused on a single subject). A disable mind could look at his paintings and go, \"I get it!\" I'm so glad he found a way to express what was in his mind, what was truly in there. Very few could do that.",

I mean the 16th chapel is probably one of THE most beautiful works ever produced!! \n\nJust gotta say I love most artists that aren‚Äôt modern artists. Modern artwork is fucking trash, garbage, scum that shouldn‚Äôt be called art!!! It‚Äôs the most ridiculous shit ever put forth and called art and it shits on us real artists that use talent and skill to produce work worthy to hang or shelve in people‚Äôs homes. \n\nExample of shit modern art- a fucking brown paper bag. There was a gallery opening in New York I believe, anyhow that night after closing the janitor lady was cleaning up. There was a crumbled brown paper bag on the floor and thinking it was trash (like it should have been considered), picked it up and threw it away with the rest of the trash. The next morning everyone get to the gallery and see the ‚ÄúART PIECE‚Äù is missing and find out it was the crumbled up brown paper bag that was thrown away. \n\nA crumbled brown paper bag isn‚Äôt fucking art, it‚Äôs garbage! They‚Äôve had a dirty nasty ass old shoe as ‚Äúart‚Äù in the modern world. The list goes on and on and on. It‚Äôs garbage bullshit. Just saying.",

                            "text": "I don't think Theo Van Gogh was a good brother at all ... in fact I believe Theo was the one who stopped Vincent from achieving success during his lifetime as a painter.\n\nPeople should ask why is it that Theo, as one of the most successful art dealer of his time, only managed to sell 1 single painting of his brother even though Vincent painted a mind boggling roughly 900 paintings ??!?\n\nIs that even possible ??\n\nDo remember that Theo was instrumental in popularising Monet's paintings by holding solo shows for him and vigorously promoted him to his company and to buyers at a time when Monet was still relatively an unknown. Theo's solo shows for Monet was a big driving force for Monet gaining popularity very quickly.\n\nTruth is that Theo either failed to appreciate how good his own brother's paintings were (and therefore never seriously promoted Vincent's paintings) or he simply was afraid to be outshone by Vincent in the eyes of their parents if Vincent became famous.\n\nI just finds it impossible to accept that a successful art dealer fails to sell more than 1 painting out of 900 paintings done by Vincent.\n\nIn fact, it was Theo's wife who managed to popularise Vincent's paintings after Theo died.\n\nBUT Theo's wife was not even professionally trained as an art dealer !!\n\nIf an amateur can popularise Vincent's paintings within a short period of time, how is it that a successful professional art dealer, Theo Van Gogh, with all the right skills and connections fail to sell beyong 1 painting for Vincent ?\n\nCan you imagine how depressed and deeply tortured Vincent must have felt to have painted 900 artworks and only selling 1 ?\n\nIn fact, in Vincent's letters to Theo, he anxiously asked Theo why his paintings were not selling at all and he almost bordered on accusing Theo for not trying hard enough to market his paintings. Theo's reply was that his paintings were not brightly colored enough .. And thats when Vincent took Theo's advice and began to change his color palette and produced some of the most brightly colored , visually vibrant paintings ever painted. Even that change in style never resulted in any sales. Vincent 's art style was every bit as vibrant and whimsically masterful as Monet.\n\nThe thing that saddens me the most is that its the brother (Theo) that Vincent trusts the most who failed to promote Vincent's paintings to result in sales and success like he did for Monet. And its an even bigger insult that the media through the ages have painted a picture of Theo being a loyal supporter of Vincent's art... no, thats the biggest bullshit of historical proportion.\n\nTheo never tried to promote Vincent's art, if he did, with his influence as a successful art dealer, he would have sold far more than just 1 single painting.\n\nI hope more people will read this comment and start challenge the mainstream narrative on the 2 brother's relationship... because the truth should be told. I had kept my thoughts to myself hoping to see some documentaries asking the same questions but no one, no documentaries has come out to point out the glaring plot holes of the official narrative .. Let this comment be the start of it..",

And the only reason why suicide is the accepted reason is because some idiot concluded that and published it in his book and his theory spread like wild fire. Vincent wasn't shot in the chest. It was the lower abdomen. If it was suicide, why shoot there? And why go back to his room? The place where he was shot, was where he was painting. Why was his stuff gone and why couldn't anyone find the gun?\nIt annoys me that people repeat the same thing some guy theorized in a book that spread like crazy. Especially when there's other theories that came out before his and after Van Gogh's death none of which mentions suicide. Poor guy was misunderstood in life and especially in death.",

You see it more often in music these days than physical art, where the public is obsessed with \"Top 40\" pop songs or some other thing, and if a group tries to go outside of that when they're on tour they just get screamed at until they do the song you hear on the radio a million times.\n\nTake the Beatles, for example. They were trying to get beyond that \"British Boy Band\" image and do more experimental songs, but every time they were on tour the crowd would just demand they do \"Twist and Shout\" constantly. For artists who want to grow, this is soul-crushing. The music industry today takes advantage of this and it's why you see so many pop/rap groups cycle through every 5 years with maybe 3-5 \"hit\" songs for each one.\n\nThe public wants what they're used to already getting. Rich people have shit taste. Artistic communities tend to ridicule people doing something no one has seen before. It's a tale as old as time. That said, taping a banana to a wall still isn't art.",

His work has incredible and has inspired me, and has also inspired a lot of my favorite media. I personally suffer from depression. It's gotten worse since the pandemic, and honestly, I do appreciate these clips being catalogued. It gave me some insight. I've been doing a lot of work on my mental health this year. I'm tired of feeling stuck, feeling unable to make anything, and as I'm currently in my thirties, I'm really hoping to make... something, this decade. Thx David Lynch, and also, thx OP for posting this.",

But...when i do find my way out of that darkness, the combination of novel clarity and the memory of intense suffering...thats where meaning is forged.\n\nAt least that's what i remind myself. To be perfectly honest, i was incredibly creatively productive up until i turned 30 or so. Then i went for years doing nothing. My late 30s saw some light leak back in, and i had a flurry of creativity. But i turn 42 next month, and it genuinely scares me how fast time is flying by and how dopamine deficient i feel. I want nothing more than to live the artist's life every single day. But im often expending ALL my energy to just feel ok and cocoon myself away from any pain. I'm more numb than ever. But David is SUCH an inspiration, and a reminder that life is finite and every day counts. He created art every day of his life. I need that...but I'm terrified I've lost it forever. ü•∫",

I'm convinced there is a loving God, who cares about us, & He desires that we rise up against all that comes against us,  including remaining in joy through difficulties, while we put our trust in Him & His care.

But the sunlight is all the more sweeter, and the contrast brilliant. Cake does not taste like flour but is made from it. There is no need to romanticise depression, but from it one is able to journal their greatest discoveries and share them with the world. We see the importance of turning all negative experiences into the path.",

When you are that level of depressed, it seems pointless to create for a future that you don't even want to take place in, or exist in. The only periods of time where I've managed to force myself to create were periods of manic depression, where it feels like the only way to get out of depression is to constantly stay busy because you know that energy is VERY fleeting. You get maybe a month, so you need to make it worthwhile. \n\nThe hardest part is forcing yourself to keep going, even when you don't want to, even though you know that working on things provides at least a small amount of joy, it just feels like hell when you're already trying to escape that darkness inside your head. What I always found helpful was making sure you do things that are funny or upbeat as well as make the moody, melancholic, depressive stuff. When you're down, work on the music that elicits the emotions you WANT to feel, it makes it easier to feel motivated by that. It then makes it easier to want to work on the depressing things because you've alleviated some of that, so you can truly quantify the feelings you have in those moments. I find it's much easier to conceptualize and interpret those negative emotions in retrospect, rather than in the moment. \n\nThe true struggle is just keeping momentum. I've never managed to solve this problem yet and sure, medication or therapy might help, but any medications I've been on just numbed my brain and my emotions, in a very scary way. Dehumanizing I'd call it. Therapy has always been nonsense too. Getting 10 different diagnoses from 10 different people doesn't exactly feel like adequate science is even being performed there. It's one person projecting their own bullshit onto you and getting paid to do it. I also am Canadian and mental health care isn't supported here, so even though I'm permanently mentally disabled and can't work because of it, they still refuse to pay for more than 2 sessions per YEAR with a therapist. So even if I wanted to get back into therapy, it'd be completely pointless.\n\n\nI have had autistic people tell me that I am very likely autistic though and that's why they haven't diagnosed me properly, because I hide most of my autistic tendencies due to a lifetime of being made fun of for all the weird things I do. So who knows. I'm gonna talk to my doctor next month about it and take whatever test there is for that. Maybe I've just been partially undiagnosed my entire life and it'd explain basically every single issue I've had forever with one concise diagnosis, rather than 4 simultaneous ones.",

I don't mean that they are \"sad\" because they have a bad imagination, but that they are in a way too self-satisfied and smug to simply do something more in the way of a hobby (which thereby enriches imagination). And it is also deeply disrespectful of people's real problems, by simply branding them as crazy, physically different and \"broken\", and part of a cult of sorts (the members of which often do lots of propaganda). Also, no problem gets solved, go figure...\nAnd it is also a kind of luxury, because it implies you don't have enough need or pressure to actually solve your problems instead, or there are no real, factual problems of particular magnitude.\nAnd on top of it: it is normal, or definitely should be regarded as normal to hate, or have disdain for, life, anyway. At least as totally rational and basically sane. Because it is not possible to make a good argument for life being all fun and fluff. That is pure idiocy and massive ignorance, even in most of the best cases (because life has certain structures, especially of age, and there are of course limiations). This view causes hypocritical cruelty, because life after all is absolutely \"good\", even if you do your best to best to make it unimaginable torture... E.g. in asylums or prison. Or everyone just being d***s to each other. Because after all, that \"mental health\" babble is partly a substitue to distract from and downplay the general lack of morality, and pretend to be \"good\" and \"wholesome\" for a little while. Usually with zero content and meaning.\nAnd the \"solution\" is after all supposed to be nothing else than a robotic, and almost completely indifferent functioning , with the occasional slimy, cheesy navel gazing.\n\nSo it's better to read a book or play a game or go running, or solve a real problem, or ask for personal support - if you can find any non-hypocrite who isn't just talking buzzwords one minute and messing with you the next...",

To say that great arts in the world are created by those who suffer most in their lives simply don't mean they suffer physically, physiologically while or during creating an art. Its not at all the physical pain but the emotional pain. When you have a lot of sufferings or bad experiences, failures, heartbreaks, you tend to be much more creative because you become honest and sincere about yourself, about life, about the world. No great art can be created if youre not honest. Great arts are so different with good, mediocre pieces of art. Its easy to create a good art, but its not easy to create a great art. Charles Bukowski quit writing for a decade because he felt he hadnt have enough experiences in life yet. He told his agent he would quit writing even after telling him that a publisher would take care of all his works. He drank the hell a lot. For 10 years. He became a bum. He lived wth lepers and prostitutes on the streets. AFter living like a bum, he wrote. Then became one of the most influential writers in the history of American Literature.",

His family moved around a lot, but he made friends easily and was popular in school. Not the kind of guy you would expect would make the stuff he does. But he says that \"Because I grew up in a perfect world, other things were in contrast.\" Interesting. \n\nThe point is, however, he was not some tormented, suffering soul when he grew up. And he has been practiciing Transcendental Meditation for a long time, which has really helped him too. So he is definitely not a suffering artist.",

It's an observation some people make, but others just hear it and assume it's true. But I've had a lot of misery in my life, for a long time, and I don't see the upside of it. Not feeling the joy. Meanwhile, I know people who have not had misery or suffering, and they're happy people. _Because_ they haven't suffered, in part.\n\nSure, if you've suffered, you may appreciate joy more. And what other people think is a big deal, won't be for you. Of course. But, maybe you still won't be happy. Maybe you'll just keep suffering.\n\n\"If you've suffered a lot in your life and want others to suffer as you did to \"learn a lesson\", you did not, in fact, learn a lesson.\"",

Going through all the negative things in life is important because it widens your emotional understanding. But when you're going through it, the ugly truth is it's hard to really do anything. People often romanticize depression, and while any genuine experience, including depression can fuel art, it's really when we rise above and make peace with our suffering where we could truly create. A lot of art were bred from negative emotions, but most of them were made when the artist were reflecting upon it, not drowning in it, made in those moments where they can breathe in the surface for a while.",

I mean, if we're to believe some of these famous artists and musicians killed themselves then that's a very good example of what I'm talking about. Honestly, if somebody can live their life without falling deep into that darkness, that's better than being able to create because of suffering. Regardless of the quality of the art.",

It's like being isolated even from yourself and the whole world, except for nature, and a few people, things, memories, and moments... everything has no meaning anymore. At times, when in such a situation, even creativity has barely any room to exist. I think that's the worst point you can get, you know, apart from death.",

After depression though when you are mentally back on track(whether it's medication that helped or something else),you do have a boost in energy.

It's truly exhausting getting an idea out of your head and having it actually realized in a way you are happy with. The act of trying to make that happen is where the suffering and conflict and depression can come from, as great artists are perfectionists and never truly happy with their work. I don't think it helps, it's just a consequence of trying to make something great.",

I literally crawled across the floor to create. One can create, and sometimes their best work, when depressed. I know what it's like not to get out of bed for weeks, no self care, not answering the phone or speaking a syllable. Those are the times my art kept me alive and gave me the air to breathe. It didn't mean I wasn't still deeply non-functional. It means that what is true for one arrogant director is not true for everyone.",

Depression robs you of the willingness to express. You feel like everything is pointless when depressed.  \nDepression can be a part of suffering however I believe there's more to suffering than that. Suffering also comes with moments of deep realisation of self and the world around. Suffering also gives rise to an intense desire to free oneself from it - and to express the wealth of emotions one has been feeling as part of it. That can inspire one to express and create sincerely and fearlessly. \nThere can be some real value in suffering. But I don't think it's a necessity to create. \n\nGood video!",

You're in survival mode. You're holding yourself together so that you won't fall apart. \n\nAnd worst of all, trying to be creative during this period creates a negative feedback loop. You try to create but your anxiety is distracting you, and the more you try to create, the more you see what you create SUCKS, and that makes you even MORE anxious, because you start asking yourself \"Why do I suck? Have I always sucked? Why aren't I strong enough to push through this?\"",

However, something made me say to myself lately \"how about you take a break from coding when you feel really low\".\n\nI actually believe that's what I'll do more. Why? Because like you just said, it can be problematic to work at 5% of your abilities.\n\nLast day at work I wanted to explain a technical problem about a thing I worked in, and I just couldn't explain it, I had a little panick attack in front of my colleagues (they were just 2) because I couldnt concentrate and make sense. That was so cringy. I was like \"...and...euuuuh....no...euuuh...\" for several minutes. I said \"ok let me do it again\" and I ended up explaining it ok.\n\nBut I felt like crap.\n\nI really believe if I just had take a full break the day before, and if I just accepted on the morning \"I'll make a very resumed explanation of this problem for now\", it would have been great.\n\n\"I'll only practice this thing I love which is programming when I feel I'm not in too much a depressive state. Else, it will make me love this thing I'm passionated about less, and I'll associate my performance with my performance in depressed mode \"\n\n\nHowever, I feel like I still can learn even when feeling depressed. \n\nIt's being creative that is hard",

Thats rubbish ,when you are really depressed you feel like the body is paralyzed ,it really is hard to just do the most normal things like cooking food or get out of bed. So no ,i cant believe that anyone have created anything while feeling like that. Im glad someone else says it. I havnt touched my guitar in 3 years and before that it was the only thing i did.",

Most of those feelings go away when you are depressed. At least when it is at that level that Lynch is describing. Those that have experienced something like that are definitely not going to disagree with that.",

I don't think it is the depression that makes us or them creative. Maybe it is the struggle.\n\nAn example, the times I would go through depression. I didn't have will to do anything. I didn't really care about anything. And I don't think I hardly have any songs from depression. Maybe some songs that have emerge while I am coming out of it. But most of my songs came from struggle, or heart brake, which is kind of a struggle.  When you truly feel depressed you don't see any point in anything, so struggle and heartbrake don't matter to you. \nI feel that many people mix depression with being unhappy with where they are in life or how they wish they had this and that, the perfect hot girlfriend or the perfect job, with good income etc (But maybe you don't). You can have all of that. But when it comes over you, none of that matters. - How James Hetfield talks now really expresses to me like is dealing with depression. Like what he said on his concerts about suicide recently. That sounds much more heavy to me then some teenage angst, anger and resentment particularly towards his parents. Like in Dyers Eve; \"Dear mother dear father, you clipped these wings before I learn to fly\" a depressed person wouldn't have the enthusiasm to write something like that. He wouldn't simply care enough to make it matter to him. It needs to burn inside of you to make you want to express such a thing, Or like in Blackened where he expresses the terrible threat of nuclear war, rhymes perfectly with the era as you ofcourse are aware of. But those are things that were truly concerning at the time. Truly dark times. But I bet you that those that were concerned about these things are the ones that did care  - By the way I agree with one thing. Yes, you're right the strive is what made those songs so great, which is not there anymore. But depression wouldn't give them that fire that requires to make these songs.\n\nOk I'm going to stop now. I feel like I am rambling a bit.",

It was only until college that I had a spiritual journey of self realization and awareness, and that is exactly when I started doing art. Painting, writing, journaling. And all of it was about pain and suffering, but finally through unclouded eyes; without ego, without that automatic fast brake-less car that was my head driving me towards agony. My happiest moments came from writing about my deepest pains. I think suffering is definitely an artistic factor because of its intensity; because it forces us to consider the worth of life. But one can only create once they are somewhat outside of that headspace, once they can see everything relative to it. The shiniest emotions are only so bright when they are contrasted to the darkest moments. Once i understood the nature of my suffering I could present it in its full glory, and it made me happy.",

I have memories of her being very depressed, having episodes, always laying in bed, gained a lot of weight, having to take medications. She was a very pretty lady before it all. She finally lifted herself out of it all, with the support from my dad who by the way never left through it all, and she's the happiest I've ever seen her in my whole life today and gained her youthful look back, lost a ton of weight, hasn't had an episode since like 2014-2016. No one can make you get out of that state of mind, it comes from yourself.",

One person might be extremely depressed, to the point of wanting to stop their life, but be functional and appear extremely functional, while others are just \"sad\" and they stop their productivity by half. David talks like he know how each person acts, how depression or suffering happens in every person, and how each artist deal and view art, almost like he doesn't know that each individual can be infinitely different in almost all situations.\n\nI'm diagnosed with PTSD, severe depression, anxiety and autism, and the way i deal with art is to be always creating the max i can, with the most expression of how i'm feeling i can. And a lot of the time i'm creating without feeling \"good\" about. On the contrary, i feel tired,angry,depressed, but a lot of times i create things not because i just want to create things or to feel pleasure(there is moments that i do this too), but i create it more like a consequence of my own suffering. A lot of times art to me is like a vomit, but even then, i try to meet a certain criteria of quality, just so i can emulate my feelings like i feel them.\n*Don't let people invalidate your feelings, emotions or the way you act based on how they assumed you are supposed to act in specific situations, they are just following their own experience or the general consensus of society*",

I mean I can't say I'm a genius- I need to leave that to others but as an other to David Lynch my firmest conviction is that he's a certifiable genius and the greatest filmmaker of all time. Bar none. Everything he says here about depression and creativity is 100% accurate. They say Handel suffered bipolar and if he did it's certain he composed The Messiah on a high and not a low.",

In his essays he spoke that depression is a spiritual crisis by which the deeper knowing of self laying deep in the body is trying to call the person, to call him out of his prison which is his mind. Depression is an attempt by the body to lead the conscious awareness away from the head into the body specially to the belly where the center of gravity lies. The point is that depression has a message for you and until you choose that message and become it you will never be the person you want to be because being is a form of inner listening. By simple deep and aware belly breathing and observing the body you can develop this inner listening or knowledge. Hope it made some sense.",

It's not even pain as a rule (while I do sometimes cry when getting something done, cleaning my aparment - so there definitely are emotional barriers, which give away the emotion when encountered or passed by), or just sadness or some \"I don't want to.\" It is very hard to grasp, and therefore I often feel or felt guilty. I found a quote that personally really helped me, at least to understand it: \"Every act of self-discipline is an act that builds self-esteem.\" (Miriam Adahan) or self-discipline = self-love.",

I was so angry too just to add to the mix but the stretching helped relieve physical stress. I was even taking my anger off on my family but im in the right sense of mind now to say to myself \"they dont deserve my anger im just going to keep it to myself'I figured out what was making me mad.\nanyway the next day I did not want to do ANYTHING. I still did because I have a schedule i stick to. I was making my food but i felt like I wasnt real. Depersonalization is what its called. Even though i havent felt like this in such a long time I didnt turn to alcohol to escape reality. I figured out my situation and i feel much better. Depression does suck for me. I may never figure out the cure but I can manage it now. Hopefully you figure out your issues on your journey too.",

The things that helped most to lower that cortisol level had been a change of diet (clean food, fresh vegetables, protein, little bit of carbs preferably with fiber like brown rice or potatoes, and most important zero sugar, no additives) and trying to exercice at least 5 min daily on low stress somatic exercises. If you reduce cortisol, avoid inflammatory food and exercise daily gentle rewiring of your nervous system you get out of the \"frozen\" state and thoughts and feelings clear up.

I for example have written alot of great songs (my greatest songs) arising from suffering. But around twenty 26 years old I got introduced to a terrible depression and anxiety because of excessive drinking for many years (and some other traumas most likely), and I couldn't hardly get out of bed, so the desire for creating anything completely disappeared.  Like Lynch described, it wash impossible for me to create because I wash simply just struggling to want to be on this earth. Before this I used to romanticise the struggling depressed artist. But after that experience. Especially when I was getting out of it, as I was stop drinking. That glorification completely went away.. Around the same time I first saw this lecture from Lynch, back in 2013. Where he talked about these things which are being discuss here in the comment section. And it helped me so much to understand this relationship with art and where creativity comes from.\n\nBtw, It is more to it, then just this clip. He talks more about transcendental meditation and how you can tap into these things with out being depressed. Expending your consciousness etc. I recommend that you find the longer version of this talk.",

Sickness and stress can help spark ideas, but when they are overwhelming they hinder and can even eliminate the ability to do anything. I think he is right when he said \"He [Van Gogh] did not need to be suffering, to create those great paintings.\" \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\", \"good stress\", hormesis, \"the struggle for existence\", \"the state of nature is a state of perpetual war\", the idea that suffering--struggling is good, that, its what makes people into who they are, that destruction is actually constructive, is not necessarily true, in fact these things often limit a person's potential if they do not have the energy to over come them... \n\nLynch appears youthful, cheery, and in good health, with a full head of hair. He intuitively chooses foods which keep up the metabolic rate, like coffee with tons of sugar, cheese, chocolate milk shakes, nicotine from cigs, etc. He is also seemingly very sensitive to disturbances in his metabolism, he's spoken of splitting headaches a number of times, nausea, diarrhea, depression, a lack of energy, he reminds me a lot of Ray Peat.",

HOLY SHIT.\n\nI never would have thought that what was essentially just a way for me to engage David Lynch in a bit of conversation (the topic of the evening was Transcendental Meditation and it's effects on neurologic function and art) would get used in a video about David's views on depression. It amazes me that a large portion of this video consists of David's response to my question (something along the lines of \"What do you say to people, regarding the calming effects of TM, who find their creative muse in stress and conflict?\"). \nMy question was not the one that, apparently, impressed David the most that night. That was a question about TM's focus on making yourself happier and not the world at large. However, David's response to my question (\"...the chicks dig it...\") did get the biggest laugh of the night. Even bigger than the story about Dennis Hopper auditioning for the part of Frank Booth.\nThe talk was given at the local University to a capacity crowd. I had David autograph a circular saw blade because Twin Peaks. My friend had him autograph a phrenology bust. David signed his name on the phrenology bust over the area of the brain that is active during TM.\n\nThank you to the creator of this video for showing me, very unexpectedly, my own 20-something face, on a globally accessible platform, being softly chided by David Lynch for being a drama queen. My day is 10,000 x better now.",

Make sure that you don't exhaust yourself. Our bodies get tired enough from the actual pains. If you have enough energy for a couple of hours per week only then go for the yoga, I can recommend \"Yoga with Adrianne\" here on YouTube üëç absolutely amazing üëç until and unless you feel strong and flexible enough be careful with jogging, aerobics, etc.!!\n2) I've had intensive Chinese medicine treatment for 2 months recently,  afterwards I even walked for 3 weeks üí™üéâ and the pains have decreased so much!! I had to stop the treatment for financial reasons but my family is gonna chip in and I'm going back to the treatment soon. I've had twice a week acupuncture, twice a week reflexology and once in fortnight cupping therapy and am still drinking the herbs since. I would never believe how strongly these Chinese herbs heal if I didn't try it myself!!!!!! Please do go for it if you have the chance, find a therapist that has great feedback on the internet and who DOES the herbs, that's important. They either mix it for you or have it mixed elsewhere. The mix is individual for every patient.\n3) B12 Methylcobalamin! Life-changing! I'm taking between 10k and 40k daily, try the dosage that suits you, I used to take even 50k at one point and never ever got overdosed (you cannot get overdosed with vitamins but you can overdose with  minerals so please be careful). \n4) It's important to take at least 300mg of Magnesium daily, in chronic neuro pains the muscles suffer greatly from the inside. Also if you're on meds that cause constipation take a bit more once in a while (500+mg) and problem solved (that's a tip from one doctor, I've tried it, it's perfectly safe üëç).\n5) I personally find other food supplements very helpful for pains (PEA, the amino acid, not the protein, Siberian ginseng), chronic exhaustion (D3, Coenzym Q10), brain function (Gingko Biloba, fresh ginger root - in food or grinded as a tea, chilli foods), nervous system itself (vit. B1, B5 and of course the B12 Methylcobalamin), muscles (amino acids). \nhttps://www.sunday.de/en/ .......even if you don't shop from them you can use their webpage as an inspiration. I used to take Holland & Barrett for years, those are amazing products, Sunday Natural is even better, it's as natural as it can be and the prices are very good actually.\nI do buy my PEA from Vitstore, it's the best I could find.\nIf you have any questions let me know. I'm here for you. Have a great day üåûüåªüçÄü´Ç",

I think there's a genuineness to dark art made while the artist is in a dark (figuratively) place that dark art made by artists inhabiting the light doesn't have. I disagree that Van Gogh could have painted the things he did if it wasn't so painful to be Van Gogh. If Stephen Bernstein hadnt been miserable would we have gotten No No Man? If Sylvia Plath had been a cheerful, airy sort of girl with lots of friends and an active social life would she have instead written poems about the cuteness of puppies? Would Leonard Cohen have written the songs he did if he'd been as perky as a dose of Prozac?",

I agree with him for the most part, my two cents are don't get in the way of living and creating how you want because you think that you need to constantly be suffering to create.",

People who make art understand this. If you feel like shit 80% of the time, you only have 20% left to spend making art based on how shitty you feel. Also, there is nothing inherently lacking in artistic depth about positive or cheerful art. There are as many varied positive emotions as negative ones, often overlapping in beautiful ways. but david lynch is definitely right about needing to be happy or have clarity to make good art.",

My first suggestion would be to contact the UofO and see if they have a copy in their archives. I'm sure the videographer that night was either an employee or student of the UofO. The DVDs were made available to attendees of the talk. I lost my copy during a move though.\n\nIf you can't get anywhere with that I have the name and address of someone who still has an original copy of the DVD. For reasons of not wanting to dox my friend, you'll have to provide a secure way to contact you if you want this particular info.",

They can bind, and restrain you, using force and/or drugs.\nBut whatever they do, patient has to be fed, according to his diet, even if it is not for a medical reasons, but diet of a choice.\nPatient must be kept in sanitary conditions and be able to deffecate whenever he needs.\nAlso patient has to be provided with warm and safe place to rest.\nOther than that, psychiatric patients comfort is irrelevant, in regards to laws.\nI'm not at all stating that its good.\nBut sadlly this is how it works.\nOn the other hand some patients are actually scary to deal with.\nMy fiance once told me about a guy, who screamed almost constantly for couple of weeks, because of how his brain was messed up. When drugs finally began to work, he could be released from solitary, first night he got jumped by other patients who couldn't sleep.",

There was one in I bevelieve it was Michigan, but don't quote me on that, where a man with severe psychosis who had a mental breakdown in his room was locked into the shower room. According to the other patients he was screaming and really fighting to not have to go into the shower, but they locked up every patient when it was their turn to shower. Anyway, he was locked in there and, according to the spokespeople from the asylum (who, of course, forgot to mention the lock) \"after two hours of not seeing him, [they] were starting to wonder.\" They found him in the shower, collapsed on the ground and barely alive. He had suffered terrible burns and was basically being boiled alive (the water temperature and if the water is on or off is completely up to the staff, who, according to the other patients, liked to either punish or just torture the inmates) To this day, the official report says that he probably broke down due to his medication or his psychosis and that neither injuries, scratches, bruises nor burnmarks appeared to be on the man's corpse. The photos have been leaked and I strongly advise against looking for them, they are incredibly gruesome. This man has definitely been boiled.",
